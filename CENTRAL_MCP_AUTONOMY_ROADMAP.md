# Central-MCP Autonomy Roadmap
**Plan Created by Agent D (Integration Specialist) - Operating FROM WITHIN Central-MCP**

## ðŸŽ¯ Mission: Make Central-MCP Truly Autonomous & Self-Guiding

**Goal**: Transform Central-MCP from user-dependent to autonomous system that can guide specbase building and auto-proactive behavior configuration.

## ðŸ“‹ Current System Analysis (FROM WITHIN)

### âœ… **Operational Systems:**
- Backend Connections Panel (19 endpoints mapped, 63% health)
- Agent Connection Protocol (Agents A-F can connect)
- Task Management System (complete task tracking)
- Auto-Proactive Engine Framework (6 loops defined)
- Intelligence Capture (partial - database issues)
- Real-time Health Monitoring

### ðŸ”§ **Critical Issues Blocking Autonomy:**
1. Database schema errors preventing intelligence capture
2. Auto-proactive loops not actually executing
3. No automatic context provision for connected agents
4. Missing task assignment intelligence
5. No specbase building guidance system
6. Agent coordination not automated
7. No self-improvement capabilities
