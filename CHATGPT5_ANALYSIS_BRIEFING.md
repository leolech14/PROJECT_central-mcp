## üìã CURRENT CONCERNS & QUESTIONS

### 1. SPECBASE ORGANIZATION & SCHEMA

**Concern**: We have a UNIVERSAL_SCHEMA but existing specs don't follow it completely.

**Questions**:
- [ ] Is the 5-category naming convention (MODULES, SCAFFOLD, CONFIGURATION, GOVERNANCE, OPS) optimal?
- [ ] Should we migrate all existing specs immediately or gradually?
- [ ] Are the 12 mandatory sections comprehensive enough?
- [ ] Is the YAML frontmatter CI/CD structure production-ready?
- [ ] Should we break the large foundation specs (0100-0400) into smaller specs?

**Files to Review**:
- `02_SPECBASES/UNIVERSAL_SCHEMA.md` (the canonical schema)
- `02_SPECBASES/TEMPLATE_OFFICIAL_V1.md` (the template)
- `02_SPECBASES/SPECBASE_STATUS_REPORT.md` (current state)
- `02_SPECBASES/SPEC_MODULES_RunPod_GPU_Integration.md` (example compliant spec)

---

### 2. INTERNAL TOOLS CONSOLIDATION STRATEGY

**Concern**: 100+ internal tools scattered across multiple directories need consolidation into Central-MCP.

**Questions**:
- [ ] What's the optimal consolidation strategy? (All at once vs. phased approach)
- [ ] How should tools be categorized and registered in Central-MCP?
- [ ] Should we create a universal tool registry or multiple specialized registries?
- [ ] What's the priority order for tool integration?
- [ ] How do we handle duplicate functionality across tools?

**Context**:
- `/Users/lech/ALLTOOLS/` - 76 organized tool categories
- `/Users/lech/bin/` - 26 shell scripts for development workflow
- `PROJECTS_all/` - 60+ projects with internal tools
- Instagram tool, MCP tools, Knowledge Base systems, etc.

**Files to Review**:
- Tool inventory (we need to create this)
- Integration architecture proposal
