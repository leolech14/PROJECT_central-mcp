# ðŸ¤– GLM-4.6 AGENT INSTRUCTIONS - SEAMLESS CONNECTION

**For**: Fresh GLM-4.6 agent (or ANY external agent)
**Connection**: Simple HTTP call (no MCP needed!)
**Complexity**: ONE curl command!

---

## âš¡ ULTRA-SIMPLE INSTRUCTIONS

### Tell Your GLM-4.6 Agent:

```
Make a POST request to:
http://34.41.115.199:3000/api/agents/connect

With minimal JSON (or even empty!):
{
  "agent": "A",
  "model": "glm-4-6"
}

Show me the response!
```

---

## ðŸ“‹ EVEN SIMPLER (For Agent):

**Just tell GLM:**

```
"Call this API:
 curl -X POST http://34.41.115.199:3000/api/agents/connect \
   -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
   -d '{\"agent\":\"A\",\"model\":\"glm-4-6\"}'

 Tell me what Central-MCP says."
```

## âœ… WHAT GLM WILL RECEIVE

```json

  "success": true,
  "sessionId": "sess_1760128...",

  "projectStatus": {
    "name": "PROJECT_central-mcp",
    "completion": "45%",
