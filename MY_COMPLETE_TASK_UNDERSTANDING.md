## üìä **TASK-BY-TASK UNDERSTANDING ASSESSMENT**

### **T-CM-INT-001: Hook Integration** ‚úÖ **FULL UNDERSTANDING + COMPLETED**

**What needs to be done:**
```
‚úÖ Modify post-commit hook to extract task IDs
‚úÖ Call Central-MCP API with task completion
‚úÖ Update local database status
‚úÖ Capture evidence of completion
```

**Do I understand?** YES - 100%
**Can I execute?** YES - 95% (Already done!)
**Evidence?** ‚úÖ Database shows T-CM-INT-001|COMPLETED|2025-10-15T23:35:32Z

**Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETE WITH PROOF**

---

### **T-CM-VER-001: Verify Data Integrity** ‚úÖ **FULL UNDERSTANDING**

**What needs to be done:**
```
1. Clone both old and new repos (finops vs PROJECT_finops)
2. Extract all blob SHAs from each
3. Compare blob sets: old blobs ‚äÜ new blobs
4. Report missing count
5. If 0 missing: ‚úÖ PASS
6. Capture evidence
```

**Do I understand?** YES - 100%
**Technical approach:** `git rev-list --objects --all | git cat-file --batch-check`
**Success criteria:** 0 missing blobs per merge pair
**Can I execute?** YES - 80% (Clear git operations, might be slow for 1GB repo)

**Status**: ‚úÖ **UNDERSTAND COMPLETELY - Ready to execute**

---

### **T-CM-META-001: E2E Autonomous Test** ‚úÖ **FULL UNDERSTANDING**

**What needs to be done:**
```
1. Start MCP bridge: node scripts/mcp-client-bridge.js
2. Verify connection: Check for "‚úÖ Connected"
3. Query tasks: curl http://136.112.123.243:3002/api/tasks
4. Claim task: Update database status to IN_PROGRESS
5. Execute work: Make actual changes
6. Report progress: API calls or database updates
7. Complete: Mark COMPLETED in database
8. Verify: Check dependent tasks unblock
9. Capture evidence: Full lifecycle documented
```

**Do I understand?** YES - 100%
**Tested:** Connection works, messages exchange
**Blockers:** Service must be stable for full test
**Can I execute?** YES - 85% (Depends on service health)

**Status**: ‚úÖ **UNDERSTAND COMPLETELY - Ready when service fixed**

---

### **T-CM-GIT-003: Create 26 Missing Repos** ‚úÖ **FULL UNDERSTANDING**

**What needs to be done:**
```
For each of 26 PROJECT_ directories without GitHub repo:
1. cd to directory
2. git init
3. git add .
4. git commit -m "Initial commit: PROJECT_name"
5. gh repo create leolech14/PROJECT_name --private --source=. --push
6. Verify: gh repo view returns success
7. Count successes vs failures
8. Capture evidence: X/26 created
```

**Do I understand?** YES - 100%
**Process:** Straightforward, just iterate
**Risks:** Some directories might be empty/backups/experimental
**Can I execute?** YES - 60% (Will try all 26, some might fail)

---

### **T-CM-GIT-002: Fix VM Sync** ‚ö†Ô∏è **PARTIAL UNDERSTANDING**

**What I KNOW needs to be done:**
```
‚úÖ 1. Rename VM repos to PROJECT_ format
   - LocalBrain ‚Üí PROJECT_localbrain
   - LocalMCP ‚Üí PROJECT_local-mcp
   - etc.

‚úÖ 2. Update git remotes to match GitHub names
   - git remote set-url origin https://github.com/leolech14/PROJECT_name.git

‚úÖ 3. Sync latest code to service location
   - rsync /home/.../ ‚Üí /opt/central-mcp/

‚úÖ 4. Restart service
   - systemctl restart central-mcp
```

**What I DON'T KNOW:**
```
‚ùì WHY is service crash-looping?
  - TypeScript errors? (348 unresolved)
  - Missing environment variables?
  - Port conflicts?
  - Dependency issues?
  - Something in the latest code?

‚ùì What's the actual error message?
  - Haven't analyzed journalctl logs deeply
  - Haven't tried running manually
  - Don't know root cause
```

**Do I understand?** 70% (Know what to do, not why it's failing)
**Can I execute?** 70% (Can try, might fail without diagnosis)

‚ùì Is the issue in the code or the environment?
‚ùì Will fixing TypeScript errors solve it?
‚ùì Are there missing env variables?
```

**Do I understand?** 50% (Know the ideal state, not how to get there)

‚úÖ 3. Archive repos first (read-only)
‚úÖ 4. After approval: gh repo delete for each
‚úÖ 5. Verify: gh repo view returns 404
‚úÖ 6. Capture evidence
```

**Do I understand?** YES - 100%
**Process:** Crystal clear, safety measures understood

**Can I execute?** NO - 40%
**Blockers:**

‚ùì How do I trigger ingestion?
‚ùì What's the API contract? (POST body format?)
‚ùì Does it require LLM integration?
‚ùì Is it automatic or manual?
‚ùì How do I verify it worked?
‚ùì What should I see in the database after?
```

**Do I understand?** NO - 30%
