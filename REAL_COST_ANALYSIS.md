# 💰 REAL COST ANALYSIS - API + COMPUTE

**Complete cost breakdown including Anthropic API usage**

---

## 🎯 COST COMPONENTS

### **1. Compute Infrastructure**

**RunPod Approach**:
```
4 × RTX 4090 @ $0.69/hr × 730 hrs = $2,014/month (compute)
```

**GCP VM Approach**:
```
e2-standard-4 @ $97/month (compute)
```

### **2. Anthropic API Costs** (SAME FOR BOTH!)

**Claude Sonnet 4.5 Pricing**:
- Input: $3 per million tokens
- Output: $15 per million tokens
- Context window: 200K tokens

**Typical Agent Usage** (moderate activity):
```
Per agent per day:
  Input:  500K tokens × $3/M  = $1.50/day
  Output: 100K tokens × $15/M = $1.50/day
  Total:  $3/day per agent

Monthly per agent: $3 × 30 = $90/month
```

**4 Agents API Cost**:
```
4 agents × $90/month = $360/month (API)
```

## 📊 API USAGE SCENARIOS

### **Light Usage** (Research/Planning)
```
Per agent per day:
  Input:  200K tokens × $3/M  = $0.60/day
  Output: 40K tokens × $15/M  = $0.60/day
  Total:  $1.20/day = $36/month per agent

4 agents: $144/month (API)

RunPod Total: $2,014 + $144 = $2,158/month
GCP VM Total: $97 + $144 = $241/month
SAVINGS: $1,917/month (89%)
```

### **Moderate Usage** (Active Development)
```
Per agent per day:
  Input:  500K tokens × $3/M  = $1.50/day
  Output: 100K tokens × $15/M = $1.50/day
  Total:  $3/day = $90/month per agent

4 agents: $360/month (API)

RunPod Total: $2,014 + $360 = $2,374/month
GCP VM Total: $97 + $360 = $457/month
SAVINGS: $1,917/month (81%)
```

### **Heavy Usage** (Intensive Coding)
```
Per agent per day:
  Input:  1M tokens × $3/M  = $3/day
  Output: 200K tokens × $15/M = $3/day
  Total:  $6/day = $180/month per agent

4 agents: $720/month (API)

RunPod Total: $2,014 + $720 = $2,734/month
GCP VM Total: $97 + $720 = $817/month
SAVINGS: $1,917/month (70%)
```

---

## 🔥 KEY INSIGHT

**VM compute cost is NOISE compared to API costs!**

```
Light Usage:    API = 60% of total cost
Moderate Usage: API = 79% of total cost
Heavy Usage:    API = 88% of total cost

Conclusion: GPU compute ($2,014) is wasted money
           when API costs dominate anyway!
```

## 💡 COST OPTIMIZATION STRATEGIES

### **1. Agent Scheduling** (Save API costs)
```
Instead of: 4 agents running 24/7
Use:        4 agents running 8hr/day

API Savings: $360 → $120/month (67% less)
New Total:  $97 + $120 = $217/month
vs RunPod:  $2,374/month
SAVINGS:    $2,157/month (91%!)
```

### **2. Task Batching** (Reduce API calls)
```
Instead of: Real-time per-keystroke responses
Use:        Batched operations every 5-10 minutes

API Savings: ~30% reduction
New Total:  $97 + $252 = $349/month
vs RunPod:  $2,374/month
SAVINGS:    $2,025/month (85%)
```

### **3. Context Window Optimization**
```
Instead of: Full 200K context every call
Use:        Optimized context (50-100K average)

API Savings: ~40% reduction on input tokens
Input cost: $360 → $216/month
New Total:  $97 + $216 = $313/month
vs RunPod:  $2,374/month
SAVINGS:    $2,061/month (87%)
```

### **4. Hybrid Model Strategy**
```
Routine tasks:     GLM-4-Flash ($0.10-0.30/M tokens)
Complex tasks:     Claude Sonnet 4.5 ($3-15/M tokens)
Critical decisions: Claude Opus ($15-75/M tokens)

Average API cost: $180/month (50% reduction)
New Total:  $97 + $180 = $277/month
vs RunPod:  $2,374/month
SAVINGS:    $2,097/month (88%)
```
