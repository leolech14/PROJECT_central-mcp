Hey chat, we are now going to develop a tool that automatically have all the official formatting rules for academic scientific papers with all the best practices on structuring the PDFs and the official rules and the best practices on writing good articles. We will store this information as knowledge ok? Because our system is going to analyze an idea, a project, identify correctly what is being developed or the hypothesis or what is being tested, what data is being studied and processed and automatically generate a fitting structure that can guarantee a perfect scientific paper structure and completeness for all the available data for the project in a way that it's meaningful, that makes sense. And a human will validate this and we will have the structure for the scientific paper and then we can generate these PDFs. THIS MUST INCLUDE VISUALIZATION TOOLS THAT WILL GENERATE ANY TYPE OF CHARTS

Awesome—let’s design this as a knowledge‑driven paper engine that can (1) understand a project, (2) select the right reporting rules and journal formatting, (3) scaffold a complete manuscript with data‑aware figures/tables, and (4) export accessible, production‑grade PDFs. I’ll give you a concrete, implementation‑ready spec (schemas, pipeline, validators, and code skeletons) plus the visualization system you asked for.

0) What goes into the “official rules” knowledge?

We’ll maintain four curated knowledge packs that are kept current and versioned (source/last‑checked/date, deprecation notes):

2) Core pipeline

Stage A — Intake & Extraction

Harvest inputs: project brief, protocol, notebooks, data dictionary, repo, preregistration, IRB.

Blueprint Extractor (LLM + deterministic parsers): slot‑fill StudyBlueprint using controlled vocab (design taxonomy + domain ontologies).

Design classifier ➜ guideline selector: maps Blueprint to applicable guideline set(s). E.g., randomized_trial → CONSORT 2025; prediction_model → TRIPOD(+AI); add SAGER if human/animal work appears. 
EQUATOR Network
+1

Stage B — Completeness & Constraint Engine
4. Checklist expander: pull the exact items from chosen guidelines; add journal “must‑include” statements (data/code availability, CRediT, conflicts, ethics). 
ICMJE
+1

5. Coverage audit: validate Blueprint + current artifacts against each required item → gap report (missing randomization details, missing TRIPOD calibration plot, etc.).

Stage C — Outline & Artifact Planner
6. Outline composer: generate a PaperOutline tailored to the journal (JournalSpec.sections_order) and reporting checklists; auto‑insert tables/figures required by guidelines (e.g., CONSORT flow, PRISMA flow, ROC/PR, forest/funnel, Kaplan–Meier, Bland–Altman, etc.). 
PRISMA statement

7. Figure plan: for each hypothesis/metric/datatype, produce ChartSpecs with captions + accessibility alt text (WCAG). 
W3C

Stage D — Drafting & Assembly
8. Section writers: prompt‑programmed LLM blocks that draft only after the coverage audit passes core thresholds; every paragraph is tied to a checklist item to reduce drift.
9. Citation builder: auto‑resolve DOIs via Crossref REST API and format with CSL style required by the target journal. 
www.crossref.org
+1

10. Front matter: authors + affiliations + CRediT roles; ORCID iDs pulled via ORCID Public API (consented). 
NISO
+1

Stage E — Export & QA
11. Renderers:
- LaTeX: plug into template (IEEEtran / acmart / els‑CAS / Springer) with Jinja2; vector figures (PDF/SVG/EPS). 
CTAN
+2
ACM
+2

- Docx/HTML (optional) via Pandoc.
12. PDF conformance:
- Tag structure/reading order, embed fonts, alt text, bookmarks → PDF/UA‑2, archive copy as PDF/A. 
PDF Association
+1

13. Production XML (optional): export JATS Z39.96‑2024 for downstream submission systems. 
NISO

3) Visualization system (generate “any type of chart”)

Goals

Data‑aware, defaults to perceptually sound encodings; emits clean vector figures sized for journal columns.

Accessibility first: alt text and readable fonts; color palettes chosen for contrast (and deuteranopia‑safe). (Alt‑text/contrast guided by WCAG 2.2.) 
W3C

Architecture

Chart Recommender: rule‑ and constraint‑based (Mackinlay‑style) + simple ML ranking. Input = data schema + analytic intent; Output = one or more ChartSpec.

Chart Renderer: backends (Matplotlib for PDFs; Plotly/Altair for interactive HTML exports).

Specialized plots included out‑of‑the‑box:

General: bar/line/area/scatter, histogram/kde/violin/box/beeswarm, heatmap, hexbin, pair plots, ridgeline.

Modeling: ROC, PR, calibration, confusion matrix, feature importance, SHAP summary, PDP/ICE, learning curves, residuals, Bland–Altman.

Meta‑analysis: forest, funnel.

Clinical/epi: Kaplan–Meier, cumulative incidence, CONSORT/PRISMA/STARD flows.

Networks/flows: Sankey, chord (SVG/PDF).

Figure‑to‑Manuscript bindings: each ChartSpec is referenced in the outline with a caption and mention anchor; alt text stored alongside.

ChartSpec ➜ renderer (sketch)

def render_chart(spec: ChartSpec, df: pd.DataFrame, out_path: str):
    if spec.type == "roc_curve":
        # compute or accept fpr/tpr; draw; add auc annotation; save as PDF
        ...
    elif spec.type == "kaplan_meier":
        ...
    # All renders: set size in mm, export to vector (PDF/SVG), attach alt_text in PDF metadata

4) Validation: making “perfect structure and completeness” operational

Guideline Coverage Score (0–100): % of required items satisfied per guideline (e.g., CONSORT/PRISMA/TRIPOD). Weighted by criticality (must/should).

Journal Conformance Score: headings order, length limits, figure/table limits, reference style, asset formats.

Accessibility Score: PDF/UA checks (tags/alt text/reading order), contrast heuristics, font embedding; warnings for failures. 
PDF Association

Ethics & Transparency Gate: ICMJE policy blocks submission if missing conflicts/registration/data sharing. 
ICMJE

Each score produces actionable diffs (e.g., “Methods ▸ Randomization: allocation concealment not described (CONSORT M2)”).

                sec["subsections"].extend(mapped if isinstance(mapped, list) else [mapped])
        outline["sections"].append(sec)
    return outline

8) Drafting guardrails

Prompt‑programmed writers are bound to checklists: every generated paragraph cites the checklist item ID and source data fields used, so reviewers can trace provenance quickly.

References come from Crossref metadata -> formatted by CSL style required by the journal; ORCID iDs and CRediT roles enforced in front matter.

9) PDF production details (so reviewers don’t bounce you)

Tag tree for headings/paras/lists/tables/figures; alt text for all figures; bookmarks/outlines; logical reading order; embedded fonts; language metadata; XMP metadata (title, authors, ORCID, funders). Conformance targets PDF/UA‑2 (ISO 14289‑2:2024). Archive an additional PDF/A copy. 
PDF Association
+1

Provide optional JATS (Z39.96‑2024) export to feed publisher platforms and repositories. 
NISO

10) Example: end‑to‑end for a clinical ML paper

Detected design: prediction_model → attach TRIPOD‑AI + SAGER. Gaps flagged: missing calibration description, no decision‑curve analysis, no sex‑stratified reporting. Engine adds sections + figure placeholders and ChartSpec for ROC/PR + calibration. 
EQUATOR Network

Journal target: nature-medicine → impose section order, data/code availability, CRediT, conflicts, ethics statements; CSL style per journal. (Generalizable pattern—JournalSpec encodes.)

Output: structured outline, drafted sections with checklist traceability, vector figures, PDF/UA proof + PDF/A archival copy, optional JATS XML.

/kb seed JSONs: JournalSpec for IEEE/ACM/Elsevier/Springer; ReportingGuidelineSpec for CONSORT, PRISMA, STROBE, STARD, TRIPOD(+AI), ARRIVE, CHEERS, CARE, SAGER.

Extractors: blueprint slot‑filling from plain text, protocol PDFs, notebook headers.

Validators: checklist coverage, journal conformance, accessibility (PDF/UA) checks.

Renderers: LaTeX Jinja templates (IEEEtran, acmart, els‑CAS, Springer), figure pipeline (Matplotlib PDF/SVG).

Writers: prompt modules tied to checklist item IDs (with provenance logging).

CLI + REST: as per endpoints above.

If you want, I can generate a starter repository layout (Python package + sample seeds + Jinja templates + a couple of working renderers for ROC/KM/CONSORT flow) and a demo run using a mock Blueprint.

Absolutely. Let’s make PURPOSE the system’s first‑class primitive—the “North Star” that constrains every downstream decision (what to analyze, how to argue, which venue to target, what figures to make, how to typeset, and how to judge “done”). Below is a concrete, implementation‑ready extension of the architecture you already liked—this time centered on Purpose.

A) Purpose‑First Architecture (what changes)

New core artifact: PurposeSpec
This is ingested/derived before anything else, and every module consults it.

Purpose drives five levers

Venue & audience selection (journal/conference, section type, readership).

Completeness (which reporting guidelines and artifacts are critical vs optional).

Evidence plan (what analyses/experiments are worth doing to maximize purpose).

Narrative strategy (how to structure arguments so the right reviewer persona says “yes”).

Rendering & accessibility (figures, visual emphasis, PDF and graphical abstract choices).

B) New/updated SYSTEMS (capabilities you’ll build)

Purpose Engine (inference + negotiation + scoring)

Inputs: user brief, project docs, constraints (deadline/budget/data access), soft goals.

Inference: extract candidate purposes (publish in X; influence clinical practice; open a dataset; advance a method; policy impact; grant renewal; product launch support).

Negotiation: weight/resolve multi‑stakeholder goals (PI, product, clinical, methods team).

Output: a locked PurposeSpec (see schema below) + Utility Function used by optimizers.

State: versioned; any deviation triggers warnings (“This change lowers Acceptance Utility −7%”).

Venue & Audience Model

Knowledge of aims/scope, article types, section order, length/asset limits, acceptance priors, reviewer personas.

Recommends venues aligned to Purpose (including preprint route + transfer chains).

Guideline Selector & Constraint Engine (existing, now purpose‑aware)

Chooses CONSORT/STROBE/PRISMA/STARD/TRIPOD‑AI/ARRIVE/CHEERS/CARE/SAGER/TIDieR etc.

Re‑labels checklist items as critical or nice‑to‑have per Purpose + Venue.

Impact & Acceptance Predictors (“Reviewer Simulator”)

Light heuristic/ML models that estimate: likelihood of desk reject, major/minor revision, impact indicators (citability, clinical uptake proxy, policy relevance).

Features: novelty signals, external validation presence, sample size/power, transparency (code/data), scope fit, clarity/readability scores, figure quality.

Evidence Planner (purpose‑guided analysis recommender)

Generates an Analysis Backlog ranked by Utility/Cost: e.g., add external validation, perform decision‑curve analysis, compute calibration & net benefit, do ablations, run fairness audits, add robustness and sensitivity analyses, perform error analysis, do human‑factors study, etc.

Connects to data availability and time/resource constraints.

Narrative Orchestrator

Maps Purpose → argument strategy using scholarly rhetoric frameworks (IMRaD + CARS + Minto Pyramid + RST).

Produces a Purpose‑aligned Outline: what each section must prove, with evidence hooks.

Visualization Planner (Purpose‑aware)

Chart recommendations guided by decision impact: e.g., for clinical adoption, prioritize Calibration, Decision Curve, Clinical Utility plots; for methods novelty, add ablation, SHAP/PDP, learning curves; for meta‑analysis, forest/funnel; for diagnostics, Bland–Altman/confusion matrix; for survival, KM/CIF.

Enforces accessibility, vector output, and venue sizing.

Compliance & Ethics Gate (purpose‑aware)

Refuses to draft beyond a threshold unless conflicts, ethics, registrations, CRediT, data/code availability meet Purpose+Venue bar (e.g., clinical impact requires stricter transparency than a workshop paper).

Exporters & QA (same stack, stricter checks from Purpose)

LaTeX/Docx/HTML + PDF/UA & PDF/A; optional JATS for production.

Purpose QA: a final “Does this PDF maximize the defined utility?” checklist.

Governance & Provenance

Complete decision log: the Purpose rationale, trade‑offs, dropped analyses, and who approved them.

C) Frameworks & Methodologies (what we’ll encode as reusable logic)

Goal systems

OKRs (Objectives & Key Results) with FAST check (frequently discussed, ambitious, specific, transparent).

Theory of Change (assumptions → activities → outputs → outcomes → impact), linking analyses/figures to outcomes.

Balanced Scorecard (scholarly variant): Learning/Innovation, Process/Rigor, Stakeholder, Outcomes.

MCDA/AHP for multi‑objective trade‑offs (acceptance vs impact vs time vs risk).

Scholarly reporting & transparency

EQUATOR family (CONSORT, STROBE, PRISMA, STARD, TRIPOD‑AI, ARRIVE, CHEERS, CARE, SAGER), plus TIDieR for interventions, CRediT, preregistration, data/code statements, FAIR data principles, RRIDs.

Rhetorical & narrative

IMRaD + CARS (Create A Research Space), Minto Pyramid, RST to keep arguments crisp and reviewer‑friendly.

Experimentation & robustness

Power/sample size, sensitivity & specificity reporting, calibration, decision curves, robustness to shifts, ablations, fairness and subgroup analyses, error taxonomy, external validation, replication.

Visualization craft

Cleveland–McGill perception guidelines, preattentive features, gestalt principles, accessibility (alt‑text, contrast), venue column/height presets.

   compute benefit = ΔUtility(A | Purpose)  # via reviewer/impact predictors
   compute cost = time(A) + data_risk(A)
   compute feasibility = has_data(A) & under_constraints
   priority_score = (benefit / cost) * feasibility
return ranked backlog


Examples of actions: external validation; decision curves; calibration; sensitivity analysis; fairness audit; ablation; prospective pilot; robustness to shift; human factors study; error analysis; qualitative user study; reporting diagram (CONSORT/PRISMA/STARD); dataset card; model card.

2) Venue recommender
score(venue) = w1*fit_to_purpose + w2*scope_overlap + w3*acceptance_prior_adjusted +
               w4*article_type_fit + w5*risk_penalty(anti_patterns)


Then instantiate JournalSpec from chosen VenueSpec and continue.

3) Outline optimizer (Purpose‑aware)

Assign every section/subsection a claim tied to a success metric (e.g., “prove clinical utility → include DCA & net benefit table”).

Greedily choose figures/tables that cover the most uncovered claims under page/figure limits.

F) Writer & Visual systems (purpose‑guided)

Writer modules

Each paragraph is justified by: (checklist item ↔ claim ↔ evidence artifact).

Style switches by audience: clinician‑friendly (plain risk language, decision thresholds), methodologist‑friendly (assumptions, ablations), policymaker‑friendly (uncertainty, external validity, implementation constraints).

Adds Lay Summary and Graphical Abstract when Purpose asks for reach.

Visualization modules

Auto‑size for venue columns; vector export (PDF/SVG/EPS).

Purpose‑specific defaults:

Clinical adoption → Calibration curve, Decision Curve, Net benefit tables, Subgroup performance, Confusion matrix with prevalence.

Methods novelty → Ablation bar, SHAP/PDP/ICE, Learning curves, Runtime/memory scaling.

Evidence synthesis → Forest, Funnel, Risk‑of‑bias heatmaps.

Diagnostics → Bland–Altman, ROC/PR with CIs.

Automatic alt‑text templates tuned to Purpose (“This figure demonstrates net benefit across thresholds relevant to… ”).

G) Purpose Gates (hard stops)

Ethics & Registration (must meet floor for human/animal/clinical claims).

Guideline Coverage ≥ 95% for Purpose‑critical guidelines.

Venue Conformance (length, sections, assets, reference style).

Clarity/Readability threshold for target audience.

Reproducibility (code/data statements consistent with Purpose promises).

Accessibility (PDF/UA tagging, alt‑text, reading order).

If any gate fails, the system produces a remediation plan ranked by ΔUtility/Cost.

H) APIs (additions)
POST /purpose/infer        -> {project_text, constraints} -> PurposeSpec + candidates
POST /purpose/lock         -> {PurposeSpec} -> PurposeSpec (versioned)

    for sec in journal_spec["sections_order"]:
        sec_block = {"name": sec, "goals": [], "subsections": []}
        sec_block["goals"] = match_claims_to_section(claims, sec, guidelines)
        sec_block["subsections"] = synthesize_subsections(sec, sec_block["goals"], guidelines)
        outline["sections"].append(sec_block)
    return outline

J) Example (how it changes decisions in practice)

Purpose: “Publish in The Lancet Digital Health and convince clinicians the model is usable within 60 days.”

Utility says: External validation (+0.12), Decision‑curve analysis (+0.10), Calibration (+0.08), Error taxonomy (+0.05), Fairness subgroup (+0.05), Ablation (+0.03).

Backlog (top 5 actions): external validation cohort; DCA; calibration with slope/intercept & Spiegelhalter Z; subgroup fairness by sex/age/ethnicity; error analysis with clinical categories.

Outline: Methods gains Model explainability + Clinical implementation subsections; Results gain Clinical utility + Subgroup performance figures; Discussion emphasizes limitations & deployment; Adds Code/Data statements; Visuals favor ROC/PR + Calibration + DCA over marginal “SOTA leaderboard” plots.

Export: PDF/UA‑tagged article, graphical abstract for clinician audience, JATS XML for submission, lay summary for press/med‑comms.

K) Risks & Mitigations

Over‑optimization to acceptance → enforce transparency/ethics floors and diversify venues.

Purpose drift → PurposeSpec versioning + alerts when actions degrade utility > X%.

Time/resource overruns → utility incorporates cost; backlog prunes low ROI analyses.

One‑size‑fits‑all visuals → audience‑specific visual defaults + accessibility checks.

L) What to build next (short, tangible sprint plan)

Purpose module: infer, lock, utility + MCDA scorer (with tests).

Reviewer simulator v0: rule‑based features + logistic baseline; expose SHAP for transparency.

Evidence planner v0: external validation, calibration, DCA, ablation, fairness as built‑ins.

Purposeful outline composer v0: claims → sections → figure/table placeholders.

Viz templates: ROC/PR, calibration, DCA, ablation, KM; vector export + alt‑text generator.

Gates: ethics floor, guideline coverage ≥ 0.95, venue conformance, PDF/UA checks.

End‑to‑end demo using a mock EHR prediction study and two different PurposeSpecs (publish‑first vs impact‑first) to show divergent plans and outputs.

If you want, I can generate a starter repo layout with the above models, a basic MCDA utility scorer, a rule‑based reviewer simulator, and working renderers for ROC/PR, calibration, and DCA—so you can run an end‑to‑end prototype on day one.

ChatGPT said:
Request for GPT-5 Pro
Reasoned for 8m 31s

Perfect—let’s harden the system. Below is a robustness blueprint that plugs directly into the Purpose‑first architecture and closes the biggest reliability, compliance, and quality gaps. I’ve grouped everything into pillars with concrete build items, interfaces, and tests so you can implement immediately.

1) Purpose Integrity & Decision Science

Why: Prevent “purpose drift,” make trade‑offs explicit, and keep all choices aligned with the North Star.

Build

PurposeSpec v2: add invariants[] (non‑negotiables) and tolerances{metric: ±delta}.

MCDA Engine v2: supports Pareto front & ε‑constraints; include scenario analysis (best‑/base‑/worst‑case).

Change‑Impact Analyzer: every config/data/model change computes ΔUtility and flags drift.

Interfaces

POST /purpose/simulate -> {PurposeSpec, proposed_change} -> {delta_utility, violated_invariants[]}


Tests

Property test: any change violating an invariant must yield status=BLOCKED.

Regression: same inputs → identical utility within tolerance (seeded).

2) Knowledge Base (Rules & Templates) Reliability

Why: Guidelines and journal rules change; we need versioned, reproducible truth.

Build

Versioned Knowledge Snapshots: immutable “as‑of” bundles (guidelines, templates, CSL) with semantic versioning.

Integrity & Provenance: SHA‑256 for each artifact; signed snapshot manifest; metadata with source URL + retrieval date.

Diff/Drift Detector: alerts when upstream sources change; produces machine‑readable diffs and deprecation notes.

Interfaces

GET  /kb/snapshot/:id      -> returns manifest + hashes
POST /kb/resolve?as_of=…   -> returns rules resolved to the chosen snapshot


Tests

Snapshot round‑trip: resolve → render → validate → identical hashes.

Broken upstream links → system falls back to last good snapshot with warning.

3) Data Contracts & Statistical Guardrails

Why: Garbage in, garbage out. Formal contracts catch schema, quality, and statistical pitfalls early.

Build

DataContract: column types, units, ranges, missingness policy, join keys, ID/PHI flags, time origin, sampling logic.

Validation Suite: schema (strict), ranges, outliers, duplicate detection, leakage rules, temporal leakage checks.

Stat Guardrails:

Minimum events‑per‑variable (EPV) thresholds.

Pre‑split leakage checks (no future data in train).

Class imbalance checks + calibrated metrics.

Confidence intervals via bootstrap for key metrics.

Interfaces

POST /data/validate  -> {dataset, DataContract} -> {errors[], warnings[], profile.json}


Tests

Fuzzing: random column permutations & unit swaps must be caught.

Seeded bootstraps return stable CI percentiles across runs.

4) Determinism, Reproducibility & Environment

Why: Two runs should match; reviewers need to reproduce the paper.

Build

Run Manifest: code commit, snapshot id, seeds, BLAS flags, hardware notes.

Pinned Environments: lockfiles (conda‑lock / uv pip‑compile); container images provably reproducible.

Deterministic Settings: set library deterministic modes where available; document non‑deterministic ops.

Artifact Registry: figures/tables/manuscript outputs hashed and content‑addressable.

Interfaces

GET  /runs/:id/manifest
GET  /artifacts/:hash


Tests

Golden‑run: repeated end‑to‑end execution → identical artifacts (bitwise for vectors/PDF structure‑equivalent).

Non‑determinism detector: warns if numeric diffs exceed epsilon.

5) Guideline Coverage Engine (Formal Completeness)

Why: “Perfect structure” means meeting the letter and spirit of the rules.

Build

Formal Checklists: encode each guideline item with type (must/should), section mapping, and verifiable criteria (evidence required).

Coverage Score: weighted by criticality; per‑section and overall; explainable (which items satisfied by which evidence).

Gap Remediator: auto‑generates remediation tasks & text prompts referencing missing evidence.

Interfaces

POST /audit/guidelines -> {StudyBlueprint, Guidelines[]} -> {scorecard, gaps[], remediation[]}


Tests

Cross‑guideline conflicts resolved by precedence rules; unit tests for edge cases (e.g., RCT + economic eval).

6) Reviewer Simulator & Acceptance/Impact Predictors

Why: Optimize for the declared Purpose (acceptance, adoption, reuse).

Build

Feature Extractors: novelty signals, external validation presence, transparency, scope fit, readability, figure quality.

Models: start with rules + logistic baseline; expose SHAP values for interpretability.

Calibration: reliability plots on held‑out “review outcome” datasets.

Interfaces

POST /predict/review_outcome -> {outline, blueprint, venue} -> {p_accept, top_risks[]}


Tests

Backtesting on historical decisions (where available); monotonicity checks (e.g., adding external validation must not reduce predicted acceptance ceteris paribus).

7) Narrative Integrity & Claim–Evidence Binding

Why: No ungrounded claims; every statement traceable.

Build

Claim Graph: each claim links to (i) checklist items, (ii) data/analysis artifacts, (iii) figures/tables.

Contradiction Detector: NLI‑style pass between abstract/results/discussion; flags mismatches (e.g., overclaiming).

Fact Sources: all factual statements cite either local evidence or a KB item; unresolved facts → warnings.

Interfaces

POST /narrative/validate -> {manuscript.md, claim_graph} -> {contradictions[], orphan_claims[]}


Tests

Injected contradictory summaries must be caught (red‑team set).

No claim without at least one evidence pointer in final PDF.

8) Visualization Robustness & Accessibility

Why: Figures must be correct, legible, and accessible across venues.

Build

ChartSpec v2: encode statistical intent, uncertainty mode (CI, PI, bootstrap), and validation hooks (e.g., ROC monotonicity).

Pre‑flight Checks: DPI, vector format, axis labeling, units, legends, color contrast, min font sizes, column‑width sizing per venue.

Alt‑Text Generator + Linter: templated, Purpose‑aware; length/clarity checks; auto‑injects into tagged PDFs.

Interfaces

POST /figures/preflight -> {ChartSpec, figure.pdf} -> {pass/fail, issues[]}


Tests

Intent violations: calibration curves must include slope/intercept + uncertainty; otherwise fail.

Accessibility: automated contrast & tag checks; fails if any figure lacks alt‑text.

9) PDF/UA & Production Compliance

Why: Accessibility and downstream ingestion are non‑negotiable.

Build

PDF Tagging Pipeline: logical structure tree, bookmarks, reading order, alt‑text, language metadata, embedded fonts.

Dual Output: PDF/UA (accessibility) and PDF/A (archival) variants.

JATS Exporter: consistent IDs linking figures/tables/references to XML.

Interfaces

POST /format/pdf -> {manuscript, assets, journal_spec} -> {pdf_ua, pdf_a, report}
POST /format/jats -> {manuscript} -> article.xml


Tests

Automated conformance checks; block on critical failures (missing alt‑text, untagged structure).

10) Privacy, Security & Compliance

Why: Scientific data often includes sensitive information.

Build

Threat Model: STRIDE‑style for each API; role‑based access; least privilege.

PHI/PII Guard: detectors on inputs and drafts; hard blocks for outbound sharing unless de‑identified.

Secrets Mgmt: KMS/secret store; zero secrets in logs; token scopes per service.

Audit Log: every decision & artifact access is traceable; tamper‑evident append‑only store.

Interfaces

POST /privacy/scan -> {text|table} -> {pii_hits[], action: BLOCK|REDACT|ALLOW}
GET  /audit/:run_id/log


Tests

Red‑team prompts trying to leak PHI must be blocked & logged.

Audit integrity: hash chain verified end‑to‑end.

11) Human‑in‑the‑Loop (HITL) Controls

Why: Humans must remain the arbiters; the system should make them faster and safer.

Build

Stop/Proceed Gates at: Purpose lock, Data validation pass, Guideline ≥ threshold, Ethics OK, PDF/UA pass.

Reviewer Console: gap reports, suggested remediations, ΔUtility from accepting/declining suggestions.

Redlining Mode: shows claim‑evidence links inline; accept/reject with comments.

Interfaces

POST /review/approve -> {gate_name, decision} -> {next_steps}


Tests

No drafting passes Gate 0 (ethics) without explicitly recorded human approval.

12) Observability & SLOs

Why: Operate this like a production system.

Build

Metrics: guideline coverage, acceptance proxy, time‑to‑first‑draft, remediation cycle count, PDF conformance rate.

Tracing: link every figure/paragraph to upstream code/data.

SLOs: e.g., “>98% runs reproducible within epsilon,” “100% PDF/UA conformance,” “<1% unresolved PII alerts.”

Interfaces

GET /ops/dashboard -> {timeseries, alerts}


Tests

Chaos tests: kill dependencies (e.g., KB service) → graceful degradation to last snapshot + clear alert.

13) Edge‑Case Playbooks (pre‑baked handling)

Registered Reports (Stage 1/2 split)—Purpose modes for prereg outcomes.

Negative/Null Results—Narrative templates to avoid publication bias; power post‑hoc cautions.

Network Meta‑analysis—Specialized figures (league tables, SUCRA) and bias checks.

Diagnostics vs. Prognostics—Switch STARD vs TRIPOD logic automatically.

Non‑English Manuscripts—I18n typography rules; bilingual abstracts; translation quality checks.

14) Expanded Schemas (drop‑in)
14.1 PurposeSpec (new fields)
{
  "invariants": ["no_phi_in_outputs", "external_validation_required"],
  "tolerances": {"acceptance_probability": 0.02, "clarity_score": 0.03},
  "risk_policy": {"ethics_floor": "strict", "pii_treatment": "block"}
}

14.2 DataContract
{
  "dataset_id":"ehr_core_v3",
  "columns":[
    {"name":"age","dtype":"int","unit":"years","min":0,"max":120,"nullable":false},
    {"name":"admit_time","dtype":"datetime","nullable":false,"monotonic":"by_id"}
  ],
  "primary_key":["patient_id","admit_id"],
  "identifiers":{"phi":["name","mrn"],"quasi":["zip3","dob"]},
  "temporal":{"index":"admit_time","forbid_future_leakage":true}
}

14.3 ChecklistItem (verifiable)
{
  "id":"TRIPOD-AI-Perf-Cal",
  "section":"Results",
  "text":"Report calibration with slope & intercept and uncertainty.",
  "required":true,
  "verify":{"artifact":"calibration_plot","fields":["slope","intercept","ci"]}
}

14.4 ChartSpec (validation hooks)
{
  "type":"calibration",
  "intent":"model_calibration",
  "uncertainty":"bootstrap_ci",
  "validators":["has_slope_intercept","bins_monotone","within_bounds_0_1"]
}

15) Test Harnesses (make failures obvious)

Unit + Property‑based tests (Hypothesis) for:

Data validators (schema, ranges, leakage).

Coverage engine (must items enforced).

Chart validators (intent constraints).

Red‑Team Suites (curated adversarial cases):

Misclassified designs (pre/post vs RCT).

Conflicting claims (abstract vs results).

PHI leak attempts within tables/appendices.

“Leaderboard‑only” methods paper failing venue fit.

Golden Corpus: ~10 representative projects (RCT, cohort, diagnostic accuracy, TRIPOD‑AI, meta‑analysis, animal study, economic eval, case report, negative results, registered report) with expected outlines, figures, and PDFs.

16) Failure‑Mode Taxonomy & Fallbacks

KB Unavailable → use last signed snapshot; warn & tag manuscript “as‑of”.

Data Invalid → block drafting; emit remediation tasks; let user override with justification (logged).

Low Utility → propose top‑3 high‑ROI actions to reach threshold; or recommend venue shift.

PDF Conformance Fail → auto‑fix tagging/alt‑text if possible; otherwise block export with diffs.

17) Operational Playbook (how we run it)

CI/CD: run full test matrix on every change; freeze new release only after golden corpus passes.

Release Channels: stable (signed snapshot), candidate (new rules/models), dev.

Rollbacks: single‑command revert to last stable snapshot & container image.

Governance: purpose lock requires named approver; ethics/data approvals recorded; audit log immutable.

18) Two‑week hardening sprint (concrete tasks)

Week 1

Implement DataContract + validator with property tests.

Add Run Manifest + artifact hashing; wire into renderers.

Build Guideline Coverage Engine v1 with verifiable checklist items.

Add PDF preflight (alt‑text presence, vector check, font embedding).

Week 2
5. Ship Purpose change‑impact analyzer and invariants.
6. Add Contradiction detector and claim‑evidence binding in drafting.
7. Build Visualization validators for ROC, PR, calibration, DCA.
8. Wire PII/PHI guard and audit logging; create red‑team tests.

Deliver end‑to‑end demo: run the golden TRIPOD‑AI case through all gates to a PDF/UA + PDF/A output with a purpose report.

19) “Done” = Robust

A manuscript is “production‑ready” only when:

Purpose gates passed and invariants respected.

Guideline coverage ≥ threshold with zero critical gaps.

Data validated under contract; no leakage.

Figures pass intent + accessibility checks; vector exports only.

Narrative claims all backed by evidence; no contradictions.

PDF passes accessibility and archival conformance; JATS exports clean.

Audit trail complete; reproducible run manifest & artifacts hashed.

If you want, I can generate a starter repo layout (folders, lockfiles, test harness, red‑team cases, example snapshots) and a minimal golden project you can run locally to see every gate and report fire in sequence.

You said:
Now I want you to provide a plan of consolidating all this knowledge in a single output that you will provide on the next message. You will consolidate all the previous messages that you sent with the total list and short explanation of each one of the concepts and elements you have brought.

Great—here’s a two‑part response:

Plan for consolidation (how I’ll structure the single “source of truth”).

The consolidated output itself (a compact, one‑stop compendium with every concept and element we’ve introduced, each with a short explanation).

1) Plan for consolidation

Goal: produce a single, navigable artifact you can hand to engineers, writers, and reviewers that captures all system concepts, frameworks, schemas, modules, gates, APIs, tests, and playbooks.

Traceability: each section references the schema/module names used elsewhere (so engineering can cross‑wire easily).

2) Purpose‑First Scientific Paper Engine — Knowledge Compendium v1.0
1) Executive Summary

A purpose‑driven system that ingests a project, selects the right reporting rules and venue, plans the evidence and visuals, drafts a complete manuscript, and exports accessible, production‑grade PDFs—with human approval at critical gates.

2) Core Principle: Purpose‑First

PurposeSpec: the “North Star” describing desired outcome (e.g., publish in venue X, drive clinical adoption), audience, constraints, success metrics, invariants, and tolerances.

Awesome. Here’s a complete, implementation‑ready development plan to take the system from a user’s first message all the way to a visually perfect, scientifically complete, purpose‑aligned PDF (plus JATS XML), including the exact core files, pipeline stages, APIs, tests, and ops you’ll need.

0) Architecture at a glance

Pattern: service‑oriented, purpose‑first, with strong domain boundaries.
Stack suggestion: Python 3.11, FastAPI, Pydantic, Celery (or Dagster) for orchestration, Postgres, Redis, S3‑compatible object store, Docker.
Key services (each with its own module + REST endpoints):

ingest (text/files → StudyBlueprint)

purpose (PurposeSpec, MCDA utility, change‑impact)

kb (versioned rules/templates/styles)

venue (VenueSpec + JournalSpec resolution)

audit (guideline coverage + gaps)

planner (analysis backlog, figure plan)

viz (ChartSpec recommender + renderers + validators)

draft (guardrailed writers + claim graph + contradiction checks)

citation (DOI/CSL)

format (LaTeX/PDF/UA + PDF/A + JATS)

privacy (PII/PHI scan)

ops (manifests, artifact registry, metrics, audit log)

Data stores

Postgres: metadata (runs, specs, scorecards)

S3 bucket: figures, manuscripts, PDFs, JATS, snapshots

Redis: queues, short‑lived caches

2) From user message to PDF — step‑by‑step pipeline

Below is the exact sequence your orchestrator (services/pipeline.py) should run. Each step lists the function, input/outputs, and blocking gates.

Stage 0 — Session start & manifest

Create run manifest

ops.manifest.start_run(project_id, kb_snapshot_id)

Output: run_id, seeds fixed, snapshot pinned.

Stage 1 — Intake & privacy

Ingest message/files

ingest.extract.harvest(inputs) → raw text, files (protocols, notebooks, data dictionary).

Privacy scan (BLOCKER)

privacy.pii.scan_text(raw_text) and scan_table() on any CSV/preview.

If PHI/PII found and policy=BLOCK → stop with remediation; else redact.

Stage 2 — Blueprint & purpose

Blueprint extraction

ingest.extract.to_blueprint(raw_text, files) → StudyBlueprint

ingest.classify.design(blueprint) → design taxonomy tag(s)

Purpose inference → lock

purpose.infer.from_inputs(blueprint, constraints) → candidates

Human picks/edits → purpose.lock(purpose_spec)

purpose.utility.build(purpose_spec) → UtilityFunction

Stage 3 — Venue & rules (KB snapshot frozen)

Venue ranking & selection

venue.rank(purpose_spec, blueprint) → list of VenueSpec

Choose top → kb.journals.to_journal_spec(venue_id) → JournalSpec

Guideline selection

kb.guidelines.select(design, domain) → [ReportingGuidelineSpec…]

Stage 4 — Data contract & validation (BLOCKER)

Data contract check

Create/attach DataContract

ingest.datacontract.validate(dataset, contract) → errors/warnings

Errors → remediation tasks (BLOCK until resolved).

Stage 5 — Coverage & gaps (BLOCKER)

Guideline coverage

audit.coverage.score(blueprint, guidelines) → scorecard, gaps

If critical gaps → planner.analyses.remediate_tasks() (BLOCK until addressed or explicitly waived by human approver).

Stage 6 — Purpose‑guided planning

Analysis backlog (ranked)

planner.analyses.rank_actions(purpose_spec, blueprint, journal_spec)

Run selected actions (e.g., external validation, calibration, DCA). Persist outputs.

Figure plan

planner.figures.plan(blueprint, actions, purpose_spec) → [ChartSpec…], with captions & alt‑text seeds.

Stage 7 — Visualization (BLOCKER for intent/accessibility)

Render figures (vector)

For each spec: viz.render.<type>(spec, data) → .pdf and .svg

Figure preflight

viz.preflight.check(figure, spec, journal_spec) → issues[]

Fail on vector/DPI/contrast/intent violation; fix or update spec.

Stage 8 — Outline & narrative

Purposeful outline

planner.outline.purposeful_outline(purpose_spec, journal_spec, guidelines) → PaperOutline (with goals/claims per section).

Claim graph

draft.claims.build_graph(outline, figures, evidence) → links claims ↔ evidence ↔ checklist items.

Stage 9 — Drafting (guardrailed)

Write sections

draft.writer.generate(outline, claim_graph, scorecard) → manuscript.md chunks

Each paragraph tagged with checklist_id + evidence pointer.

Contradiction checks (BLOCKER)

draft.contradiction.validate(manuscript.md) → contradictions[]

Orphan claims, overclaiming → remediation required.

Stage 10 — Citations & front matter

Citations

citation.crossref.resolve(dois|queries) + citation.csl.format(style) → references.bib / references.json

Front matter

Authors, affiliations, ORCIDs, CRediT roles, conflicts, funding, registrations, ethics, data/code availability.

Stage 11 — Formatting & exports (BLOCKER for PDF/UA)

Assemble LaTeX

format.latex.assemble(manuscript.md, figures, journal_spec) → .tex

PDF/UA + PDF/A

format.pdf.export.produce_pdf_ua(tex) + produce_pdf_a(tex)

format.pdf.preflight.pdfua_check(pdf) + pdfa_check(pdf) → BLOCK on failures.

JATS XML

format.jats.build_xml(manuscript, references, assets, ids) → article.xml

Stage 12 — Final gates & delivery

Purpose QA

ΔUtility vs targets, gates satisfied → ops.metrics.log()

Store artifacts & sign

ops.artifacts.hash_artifact(pdf) and store; sign manifest; write audit log.

Deliver

Provide links to paper.pdf (PDF/UA), paper-archival.pdf (PDF/A), article.xml (JATS), plus a purpose report and coverage report.

5) The orchestrator DAG (pseudo‑code)
# services/pipeline.py
def run_end_to_end(inputs):
    run = manifest.start_run(inputs.project_id, inputs.kb_snapshot_id)

    raw = ingest.extract.harvest(inputs)
    privacy.pii.guard(raw)  # BLOCKER

    bp = ingest.extract.to_blueprint(raw)
    bp.design = ingest.classify.design(bp)

    purpose_cands = purpose.infer.from_inputs(bp, inputs.constraints)
    purpose_spec = purpose.lock(select(purpose_cands))
    util_fn = purpose.utility.build(purpose_spec)

    venues = venue.rank(purpose_spec, bp)
    journal = kb.journals.to_journal_spec(venues[0].venue_id)
    gls = kb.guidelines.select(bp.design, bp.population.get("domain", ""))

    data_ok = ingest.datacontract.validate(inputs.dataset, inputs.data_contract)  # BLOCKER

    scorecard, gaps = audit.coverage.score(bp, gls)  # BLOCKER on critical gaps

    actions = planner.analyses.rank_actions(purpose_spec, bp, journal)
    selected = choose_with_utility(actions, util_fn, budget=inputs.analysis_budget)
    evidence = run_actions(selected)  # e.g., external validation, calibration, DCA

    charts = planner.figures.plan(bp, selected, purpose_spec)
    figs = [viz.render.dispatch(c, evidence[c.figure_id]) for c in charts]
    for f, c in zip(figs, charts): viz.preflight.check(f, c, journal)  # BLOCKER

    outline = planner.outline.purposeful_outline(purpose_spec, journal, gls)
    claim_graph = draft.claims.build_graph(outline, evidence, figs)
    manuscript = draft.writer.generate(outline, claim_graph, scorecard)

    draft.contradiction.validate(manuscript)  # BLOCKER

    refs = citation.csl.format(inputs.csl_style, citation.crossref.resolve(inputs.references))
    tex = format.latex.assemble(manuscript, figs, refs, journal)
    pdf_ua = format.pdf.export.produce_pdf_ua(tex)
    format.pdf.preflight.pdfua_check(pdf_ua)  # BLOCKER
    pdf_a  = format.pdf.export.produce_pdf_a(tex)
    jats   = format.jats.build_xml(manuscript, refs, figs)

    purpose_report = purpose.utility.evaluate(util_fn, collect_metrics(manuscript, figs, evidence))
    manifest.finalize(run.id)
    return deliver(pdf_ua, pdf_a, jats, purpose_report, scorecard)

6) Visualization system — “any type of chart” done right

Renderers (Matplotlib for PDF; optional Plotly/Altair for HTML):

General: bar/line/scatter, hist/kde/violin/box, heatmap/hexbin, pair plots, ridgeline

Clinical/epi: ROC/PR (with CIs), calibration (slope, intercept, Spiegelhalter Z), confusion matrix (with prevalence), DCA/net benefit, Kaplan–Meier, CIF

Diagnostics: Bland–Altman, STARD flow diagrams

Meta‑analysis: forest plots, funnel plots

Modeling: SHAP summary, PDP/ICE, learning curves, residuals, ablation bars

Preflight validators:

Vector format enforced (PDF/SVG); font sizes ≥ venue min; contrast & color‑blind safety; correct axis units; statistical intent rules (e.g., ROC monotone, calibration 0–1 bounds).

Alt‑text generator uses spec intent + numeric callouts; injected into LaTeX → tagged PDF.

7) Testing & quality gates (how we know it’s right)

Unit/property tests

datacontract.validate: schema/range/leakage checks (property‑based with fuzzing)

coverage.score: “must” items enforced, edge cases (RCT+economic eval)

viz.validators: ROC monotonicity, calibration sanity, DCA threshold ranges

contradiction.validate: injected contradictions caught

Integration tests

End‑to‑end on Golden Corpus (10 archetypes). Expected outline sections, figure counts, PDF/UA passes.

Red‑team

PHI leak attempts; leaderboard‑only drafts; venue mismatch; purpose drift; non‑determinism.

Ops checks

Reproducibility: repeated runs produce identical vector assets; PDF structure equivalence within epsilon.

PDF/UA & PDF/A conformance via validator; JATS XML against schema.

8) Security & privacy plan (build items)

PII/PHI guard on all text/tables pre‑draft; block/obfuscate or require approval.

Secrets in KMS; least‑privilege service accounts; no secrets in logs.

Audit log is append‑only with hash chaining; every approval & override recorded.

Data governance: DataContract defines what can leave the boundary; export controls enforced.

9) Operational playbook

SLOs: 100% PDF/UA pass; >98% reproducibility; <1% unresolved PII alerts.

Release channels: stable (signed KB snapshot), candidate, dev.

CI/CD: run unit + integration + golden corpus + pdf/jats validators on each PR; block merges on gate fails.

Rollbacks: pin snapshot/image; one‑command rollback.

10) Milestones & stepwise build plan (with tangible outputs)
Milestone 1 (Days 1–7): Foundations

pe run --kb-snapshot dev-2025-10-01


Inspect outputs

outputs/<run_id>/paper.pdf, paper-archival.pdf, article.xml, purpose_report.json, coverage_report.json

12) Definition of Done (for each run)

Purpose invariants held; ΔUtility vs targets acceptable.

Data validated; no leakage; privacy policy satisfied.

Guideline coverage ≥ threshold; zero critical gaps.

Figures pass intent + accessibility preflight; vectors only.

Manuscript has no contradictions; claims bound to evidence.

PDF passes PDF/UA; archival PDF/A produced; JATS valid.

Manifest signed; artifacts hashed; audit trail complete.

This plan gives you exact files, functions, pipeline order, blockers, and milestone sequencing to build the end‑to‑end system—from a user’s first message to an accessible, journal‑compliant, purpose‑maximizing scientific paper with high‑quality figures. If you want, I can generate starter files (empty modules with docstrings and TODOs) to scaffold the repo so your team can start committing against this structure immediately.

Reasoned for 6m 2s

Absolutely—here’s a refined, consolidated architecture that trims what’s unnecessary, expands where reliability and clarity demand it, and locks in the system’s shape for fast implementation and safe scale.

0) What we trimmed vs. expanded

Trimmed (to reduce complexity now)

Collapse 13 micro‑services into 6 domain services inside a modular monolith (separate packages, one deployable).

Merge venue + kb into a single rules service; fold citation into format (keeps interfaces simple).

One durable workflow orchestrator (Temporal or Dagster, pick one), not Celery + Dagster together.

One Postgres (metadata) + one object store (artifacts) + Redis (caching/ratelimits). No extra datastores.

Expanded (where we needed more rigor)

State machine for the end‑to‑end pipeline with explicit human “approval” signals.

Plugin SPI for Guidelines, Journals, and Charts (safe extension without editing core).

DataContract + Dataset Versioning; content‑addressed artifacts (CAS).

Security & tenancy boundaries; OPA policy hooks for approvals; tamper‑evident audit log.

Observability: OpenTelemetry tracing, metrics, logs; SLOs + error budgets.

PDF/UA tagging pipeline details; JATS exporter IDs and linking model.

Bounded contexts (packages)

ingest – privacy scan, blueprint extraction, design classification, data contracts

purpose – PurposeSpec, MCDA utility, change‑impact simulator

rules – knowledge snapshots (guidelines + journals), coverage engine

planner – analysis backlog, outline composer, figure planner

author – claim graph, guarded drafting, contradiction checks, viz rendering & preflight

format – citations, LaTeX assembly, PDF/UA & PDF/A, JATS

ops – manifests, artifact CAS, audit log, metrics

We keep author.viz as a subpackage (renderers + validators) to avoid a separate service.

2) End‑to‑end as a state machine

Each transition is idempotent; failures resume at the last safe state.

3) Contracts & core models (must‑haves)

PurposeSpec (with invariants[], tolerances{}, constraints{}, stakeholders[])

UtilityFunction (MCDA vector)

StudyBlueprint (design, population, outcomes, predictors, datasets, ethics)

DataContract (schema, units, ranges, temporal/leakage rules, identifiers)

JournalSpec / VenueSpec (format + persona)

ReportingGuidelineSpec + ChecklistItem(verifiable)

PaperOutline (sections→goals→claims)

ChartSpec v2 (intent, uncertainty, validators, accessibility)

RunManifest (snapshot id, seeds, env locks)

ClaimGraph (claim → evidence → figure/table → checklist ids)

All are Pydantic models with JSON Schemas emitted at build (used for API validation and UI forms).

5) Orchestration choice (pick one and commit)

Temporal (recommended for long‑running, human‑in‑the‑loop): durable timers, signals, retries, compensation.

Dagster (if data‑centric & Python‑native ops): solids/assets, asset materialization lineage.

Either way, run the pipeline as a single workflow with child tasks per state. No dual orchestrators.

6) Data & storage architecture

Postgres (metadata) – key tables

runs(run_id, snapshot_id, state, started_at, finished_at)

purpose(run_id, jsonb)

blueprint(run_id, jsonb)

journal_spec(run_id, jsonb)

guideline_scorecard(run_id, jsonb)

analysis_actions(run_id, jsonb)

chart_specs(run_id, jsonb)

claim_graph(run_id, jsonb)

manuscript(run_id, md, version)

citations(run_id, jsonb)

approvals(run_id, gate, approver, time, decision, delta_utility)

audit_events(run_id, seq, hash, prev_hash, payload)

Object store (S3 layout)

s3://bucket/runs/<run_id>/
  figures/<figure_id>.pdf
  vectors/<figure_id>.svg
  manuscript/manuscript.md
  latex/paper.tex
  exports/paper_ua.pdf
  exports/paper_a.pdf
  exports/article.xml
  reports/purpose.json
  reports/coverage.json


CAS (content‑addressed storage)

Every artifact also stored under cas/<sha256>; DB maps logical → sha256.

7) Extension points (Plugins)

Guidelines

rules/guidelines_plugins/*.py — exposes applies_to(design, domain), checklist(), verify(item, evidence).

Journals

rules/journal_plugins/*.py — provides JournalSpec and formatting quirks.

Charts

author/viz/render_plugins/*.py — registers chart_type, validate(spec), render(spec, df).

Discover via Python entry points or a simple registry pattern; load only from signed packages.

8) Security, tenancy, and approvals

Tenancy: tenant_id on every table row; S3 prefixes per tenant; IAM policies restrict access.

PII guard: block on PHI unless policy says REDACT; events logged to audit chain.

Secrets: KMS; never in logs; short‑lived tokens for external APIs (Crossref, ORCID).

Policy: OPA/Gatekeeper policies for “who may approve which gate” and “which exports allowed”.

Approvals: cryptographic signature (public key per approver) appended to audit chain.

9) Observability & SLOs

Tracing: OpenTelemetry spans for each state + heavy steps (viz.render, pdf.export).

Metrics:

Coverage ≥ threshold rate

PDF/UA pass rate

Reproducibility rate (artifact diffs = 0 within epsilon)

Mean time to S15 DELIVERED (by venue/size)

PII alert rate

Logs: structured JSON; redact PHI.

SLOs: 100% PDF/UA pass for delivered artifacts; >98% reproducibility; <1% unresolved PII alerts; 0% orphan claims.

10) Critical paths and performance

CPU‑bound: PDF compilation, CI validators, bootstrap CIs → assign to “build” workers.

Memory/GPU‑bound (optional): large NLI/LLM steps (“author” package) → separate pool; throttle concurrency.

I/O‑bound: Crossref/ORCID calls → async client + bounded concurrency.

11) Sequence (text → PDF) with call sites (concise)
API /submit -> Workflow.start(run_id)
  ingest.privacy.scan -> S1
  ingest.extract.to_blueprint -> S2
  purpose.infer + lock -> S3 (await APPROVE_PURPOSE)
  rules.journals.venue_rank + to_journal_spec; guidelines.select -> S4
  ingest.datacontract.validate -> S5
  rules.guidelines.coverage_score -> S6 (block if critical gaps)
  planner.analyses.rank_actions -> run selected -> S7
  planner.figures.plan -> author.viz.render -> preflight -> S8
  planner.outline.purposeful_outline + author.claims.build -> S9
  author.writer.generate -> S10
  author.contradiction.validate -> S11
  format.latex.assemble -> S12
  format.pdf.export (UA/A) + preflight -> S13
  format.jats.build_xml -> S14
  ops.manifest.finalize + artifacts.sign -> S15 (await APPROVE_FINAL)

12) Error taxonomy & recovery

DATA_CONTRACT_FAIL → back to S5; require remediation.

COVERAGE_CRITICAL → back to S6; auto‑remediation tasks + ΔUtility impact.

FIGURE_PRECHECK_FAIL (contrast/vector/intent) → re‑plan/respec; keep evidence.

CONTRADICTION_FOUND → annotate offending paras → regenerate or edit.

PDFUA_FAIL → auto‑fix tags/alt‑text if possible; otherwise emit diff and block.

POLICY_DENY (OPA) → require approver with higher clearance.

All failures write to audit chain with deterministic replay inputs.

13) Testing matrix (what must exist before GA)

Unit/property: datacontract, coverage verification, chart validators, contradiction detector.

Integration: run each Golden Corpus archetype to S15; assert outputs & reports.

Replay tests: re‑run manifests; assert bit‑identical vectors, PDF structure equivalence.

Chaos: KB snapshot offline → fallback to last good; Crossref 429 → backoff and cache; S3 write fail → retry with idempotent key.

Security: PII red‑team prompts; policy bypass attempts; tenancy isolation.

14) CI/CD & releases

Pipelines: lint → unit → integration → golden corpus → PDF/UA validator → JATS schema → SBOM → sign artifacts.

Channels: dev (unsigned KB), candidate (frozen KB), stable (signed KB + signed container).

Rollbacks: pin snapshot + container tag; database migrations backward compatible for one minor.

15) Reference configurations (samples)

Pydantic settings

WORKFLOW_BACKEND: temporal # or dagster
DB_DSN: postgresql://...
S3_BUCKET: paper-engine
KB_SNAPSHOT_ID: stable-2025-10-01
OPA_URL: http://opa:8181
PDF_WORKERS: 4
AUTHOR_WORKERS: 2
VIZ_WORKERS: 3
TENANCY_MODE: strict


OPA policy (sketch)

package gates

default allow = false
allow {
  input.gate == "APPROVE_PURPOSE"
  input.user.role in {"PI","ResearchManager"}
  input.tenant == input.user.tenant
}

16) Migration path (when to split services)

Split #1: format (heavy LaTeX/PDF) → separate deployment when queue saturation > 70%.

Split #2: author (LLM/NLI) → own pool/GPU nodes.

Split #3: rules (KB sync) → when snapshot builds need independent cadence.

17) “Definition of Ready” for each state (guardrails)

S3: RunManifest created, KB snapshot pinned.

S6: Scorecard ≥ threshold, no must gaps.

S8: All figures vectorized, contrast pass, intent validators pass.

S11: Zero contradictions; 0 orphan claims.

S13: PDF/UA validator pass; fonts embedded; alt‑text present.

S15: Approvals recorded; CAS hashes stored; audit chain sealed.

18) What to build first (architecture‑backed, minimal)

State machine + RunManifest (Temporal/Dagster + ops.manifest).

KB snapshot loader (rules.snapshot) with a small, signed dev snapshot.

Privacy + DataContract validators (ingest).

Guideline coverage engine (rules.guidelines).

Viz: ROC/PR/Calibration/DCA + preflight.

LaTeX assembly + PDF/UA exporter with a single template.

Authoring: claim graph + contradiction check (start simple).

Purpose inference + MCDA (baseline rules + weights).

With those, you have a stable spine; everything else is an incremental plugin.

This is the lean, durable, and extensible architecture that keeps the purpose‑first promise, guarantees scientific and formatting completeness, and makes operational excellence (reproducibility, accessibility, and auditability) a first‑class outcome. If you want a starter repo tree with empty packages, settings, and a Temporal/Dagster workflow scaffold matching this design, I can generate it next.

Below is a 10×‑simplified knowledge set you can drop into your system, plus a tight validation program that tells you—objectively—whether the manuscript would likely pass desk‑checks and peer review at serious journals.

A) The 10× Knowledge Set (what to keep; what to ignore)
1) Canonical paper archetypes → one line of rules each

Map every project to one of these archetypes; each has a single primary guideline and a minimal figure/table set. Don’t branch unless you must.

Archetype	Primary reporting rule	“Always‑include” artifacts (figures/tables)
Randomized clinical trial (RCT)	CONSORT (latest; 2025 update)	CONSORT flow; baseline table; primary outcome effect (CI); harms; protocol deviations. 
EQUATOR Network
+1

Observational (cohort/case‑control/cross‑sectional)	STROBE	Study flow; baseline table; effect sizes with CIs; missing‑data handling. 
EQUATOR Network

Diagnostic accuracy	STARD 2015	Flow of patients/tests; 2×2 confusion table; ROC/PR; calibration/decision thresholds. 
EQUATOR Network
+1

Prediction model (clinical/ML)	TRIPOD + TRIPOD‑AI (2024)	Dataset splits; ROC/PR; calibration (slope/intercept); decision curve; model card summary. 
EQUATOR Network
+1

Systematic review / Meta‑analysis	PRISMA 2020	PRISMA flow; risk‑of‑bias table; forest (and funnel if applicable). 
PRISMA statement
+1

Animal (in vivo)	ARRIVE 2.0	Experimental design diagram; randomization/blinding info; sample‑size rationale; harms. 
arriveguidelines.org

Health economic evaluation	CHEERS 2022	Model schematic; perspective/time horizon; ICER tables; uncertainty (PSA tornado/CE plane). 
EQUATOR Network
+1

Case report	CARE	Timeline; diagnostics/therapeutics; outcome; patient perspective/consent statement. 
CARE Case Report Guidelines

(Cross‑cutting for interventions)	TIDieR (how to describe interventions)	“Recipe” table for the intervention (who/what/when/where/how much/why). 
EQUATOR Network

Keep the archetype table in code and pick exactly one primary rule per project; add cross‑cutting rules (TIDieR/SAGER/etc.) only if the evidence requires.

2) One IMRaD skeleton with three claims

Everything hangs on three claims your paper must prove:

Why it matters (gap/novelty/importance).

What was done (design/methods faithful to the guideline).

What it shows (results/limitations/implications).

Use IMRaD + a purpose line under the title. Tie each paragraph to a checklist item ID from the chosen rule.

3) Golden figure sets (don’t overproduce)

Bind each archetype to a small, canonical figure set sized for the target journal’s column width; export vector (PDF/SVG) only; include alt‑text.

ROC and PR with CIs for classification; calibration curve with slope/intercept for models; decision‑curve/net benefit when adoption is a goal.

PRISMA/CONSORT/STARD flows as templates filled from your evidence.

Meta‑analysis → forest (+ funnel if bias analysis).

Animal studies → ARRIVE “Essential 10” coverage visuals where useful. 
arriveguidelines.org

Accessibility + PDF compliance: WCAG 2.2 for contrast/alt text; PDF/UA‑2 tagging; archive a PDF/A copy.

5) Statistical reporting micro‑rule (one page)

Adopt SAMPL as your house style: always report effect sizes, exact p‑values, confidence intervals, assumptions, missing‑data handling, and how multiplicity was addressed. Build linters around this. 
EQUATOR Network
+1

6) Small glossary your writers see (and nothing else)

Purpose (North Star), Archetype, Checklist item, Claim, Evidence artifact, Figure spec, Coverage score, Desk‑reject filter.

7) Minimal submission pack (always shipped)

Cover letter (scope fit + novelty + ethics/registration).

Completed guideline checklist (PDF/Word per rule).

Data & code availability; conflicts; funding; ethics; CRediT roles; ORCIDs.

PDF/UA‑2 + PDF/A; (optional) JATS.

B) Validation program (how we know it’s “first‑class & publishable”)

Use nine gates; each has an automated check, a pass bar, and—if failed—a small remediation list. Passing all nine = “Submission‑ready”.

Gate 0 — Ethics & registration (BLOCKER)

If interventional human trial: verify prospective registration (registry + date < first enrollment) and include ID in abstract/full text. ICMJE requires this for consideration. Auto‑check registry ID format and existence. 
ICMJE

Gate 1 — Archetype & guideline fit (BLOCKER)

Single archetype chosen; primary guideline checklist attached (CONSORT/STROBE/PRISMA/STARD/TRIPOD(+AI)/ARRIVE/CHEERS/CARE). Coverage ≥ 95% of “must” items and ≥ 80% of “should”; every item links to evidence (table/figure/paragraph). 
CARE Case Report Guidelines

Gate 2 — Journal conformance (BLOCKER)

Section order, word/page/asset limits, figure formats, reference style (via CSL), statement set (data/code/ethics/conflicts)—all 100% green. Samples and reporting summaries for Nature‑family handled. 
Citation Style Language
+1

Gate 3 — Statistics quality (BLOCKER)

SAMPL compliance: effect sizes + CIs for all key outcomes; assumptions & diagnostics reported; multiplicity policy; missing‑data strategy; pre‑registered vs exploratory labeled. Linter flags violations; zero critical offenses allowed. 
EQUATOR Network

Gate 4 — Figures that persuade (BLOCKER for intent)

Golden set present per archetype; ROC monotone, calibration includes slope/intercept + uncertainty, decision‑curve when clinical adoption is claimed; PRISMA/CONSORT/STARD flows correct; vector export only; alt‑text present. 
EQUATOR Network
+1

Gate 5 — Accessibility & archiving (BLOCKER)

PDF passes PDF/UA‑2 validator (tag tree, reading order, alt‑text, embedded fonts). PDF/A archival copy produced. 
ISO
+1

Gate 6 — Originality & overlap

Crossref Similarity Check/iThenticate score within journal‑typical range; all overlaps justified/quoted. Keep a JSON of matches with your adjudication. 
www.crossref.org

Gate 7 — Narrative integrity (no spin)

Claim–evidence graph has no orphan claims; abstract/results/discussion contradiction check clean; limitations state plausible threats to validity; conclusions match analysis scope (no generalization beyond data).

Gate 8 — Reproducibility capsule

Containerized run reproduces tables/figures from raw/processed data with one command; environment lockfile present; manifests + hashes stored; (if applicable) FAIR‑compatible dataset citation and repository link; NIH DMS alignment if funded by NIH. 
Nature
+1

Gate 9 — Reviewer‑persona checklist & scope

COPE‑aligned peer‑review expectations simulated for: methods/stat reviewer, domain expert, and editor. Auto‑questions answered (external validation? calibration? harms? transparency?); produce a “risk‑to‑acceptance” list with fixes. 
Publication Ethics

C) The three numbers you track (and how to compute them)

Guideline Coverage = weighted % of satisfied “must/should” items from the primary guideline (and any mandated cross‑cutting rule).

Submission Readiness Index (SRI) = 0.35 × Coverage + 0.20 × StatsQuality + 0.15 × JournalConformance + 0.10 × Reproducibility + 0.10 × Accessibility + 0.10 × Originality (all 0–1).

Scope Fit = binary pass/fail from venue rules + editorial checklist (e.g., Nature reporting summary where required). 
Nature

Set go criteria: Coverage ≥ 0.95 (musts), SRI ≥ 0.90, Scope Fit = Pass.

D) What actually makes this 10× simpler (opinionated defaults)

One archetype at a time. Never mix (e.g., “observational + diagnostic”) in the same submission; pick the primary one and cite the other in methods if needed.

One golden figure set per archetype. Only add more if a checklist item demands it.

One page of statistics rules. Use SAMPL; let the linter enforce it.

F) Minimal evaluator rubrics (how humans confirm the pass)

Give reviewers a one‑screen rubric with five dimensions (0–3 each):

Completeness vs rule (e.g., CONSORT/PRISMA/TRIPOD‑AI).

Rigor & statistics (SAMPL; effect sizes; assumptions; uncertainty). 
EQUATOR Network

Clarity & structure (claim‑evidence alignment; no contradictions).

Ethics & transparency (ICMJE disclosures; registration; data/code). 
ICMJE

Fit & impact (venue scope; audience value; figures tell the story).

Require ≥ 12/15 with no zeros to release.

G) Evidence that your bar matches real‑world peer review

Journals routinely enforce these rules at desk‑check:

ICMJE authorship/conflicts & trial registration for interventional studies. 
ICMJE

EQUATOR guideline adherence (CONSORT, PRISMA, STROBE, STARD, TRIPOD, ARRIVE, CHEERS, CARE).

H) What to implement next (to lock this in)

Archetype switch + checklist loader (one line of code chooses the primary rule, attaches its checklist & golden figure set).

SAMPL linter (effect sizes + CIs present; exact p‑values; assumptions noted). 
EQUATOR Network

Intent validators for figures (ROC monotonicity; calibration slope/intercept + CI; decision‑threshold coverage).

PDF/UA‑2 + PDF/A exporter + validator hook in the build.

Similarity‑check connector (store raw matches & your adjudication). 
www.crossref.org

Peer‑review simulator seeded by COPE/ICMJE prompts (generates a risk list and suggested fixes).

TL;DR

Pick one archetype and its one primary guideline.

Enforce SAMPL for stats, and ICMJE/COPE/CRediT/FAIR for policy.

Render only the golden figure set (with intent checks) and PDF/UA‑2 + PDF/A.

Pass the nine gates. If all are green, your paper is truly submission‑ready by mainstream journal standards.

Brilliant direction. Let’s atomize the scientific paper, define a small paper‑algebra, and wire it to a deterministic pipeline where an LLM is only a constrained surface‑realizer. Below is the complete knowledge set and build spec to make the system 10× simpler while increasing impact.

0) North‑Star recap (for the algebra)

Purpose: Automatically map any idea/theory into a journal‑grade scientific paper.
Method: Decompose to atoms (minimal, optimally meaningful units) → store in tidy tables → apply algebraic formulas (patterns/constraints) → generate deterministic sections, figures, and PDFs, with an LLM optionally polishing wording under hard constraints.

1) Universal Scientific Paper Ideal Schema (USPIS) — Atom taxonomy

We treat every element as a typed variable with metadata. Atoms fall into six families:

Study atoms (S*) — what the research is.

S.design, S.population, S.inclusion_criteria, S.sample_size, S.outcomes[], S.predictors[], S.intervention, S.comparator, S.follow_up, S.randomization, S.blinding, S.validation_scheme, S.missing_data_strategy, S.ethics, S.registration_id, S.data_source, S.code_repo, S.timeline.

Evidence atoms (E*) — what the data shows.

E.descriptives (Table 1 variables), E.effect_size{value,CI,p}, E.roc{auc,ci}, E.pr{auprc,ci}, E.calibration{slope,intercept,ci}, E.net_benefit{threshold,nb}, E.km{survival,ci}, E.sensitivity_analysis[...], E.subgroup[...], E.bias_risk, E.meta_effects, E.diagnostics (Spiegelhalter Z, residuals, etc.).

Guideline atoms (G*) — what must be reported.

G.primary (CONSORT/STROBE/PRISMA/STARD/TRIPOD‑AI/ARRIVE/CHEERS/CARE),

G.items[] (each has id, text, must/should, verification).

Rhetorical atoms (R*) — how we say it.

R.claim (gap/novelty, main result, implication), R.limitation, R.caveat, R.future_work, R.harms, R.implementation.

Asset atoms (A*) — what we show.

A.figure{type,spec,alt_text}, A.table{schema,rows}, A.diagram{consort|prisma|stard}, A.supplement[...].

Policy/Packaging atoms (P*) — what journals always ask.

P.authors{CRediT,ORCID}, P.conflicts, P.funding, P.data_availability, P.code_availability, P.ethics_statement, P.registration_statement, P.reporting_checklist, P.cover_letter.

All atoms carry metadata: source, provenance, version, units, privacy_flag, guideline_links[], purpose_links[], validation_status.

2) Atom Store — minimal relational schema (tidy tables)

atoms (one row per atom)

atom_id (uuid), run_id, family (S|E|G|R|A|P), type, subtype,

value_json, units, created_by, created_at, snapshot_id,

privacy (none|pii|phi), criticality (must|should|info), validation_status (pass|warn|fail).

atom_links (graph edges)

src_atom_id, dst_atom_id, role (e.g., supports, requires, satisfies, visualizes, cites).

requirements (journal/guideline)

req_id, guideline_id, must_bool, verify_spec (JSONPath/SQL + predicate).

witness (proof that a requirement is satisfied)

req_id, atom_id, evidence (hash/pointer), verdict (pass|fail), reason.

figures (convenience view over A.figure)

figure_id, chart_type, spec_json, file_sha256_pdf, file_sha256_svg, alt_text, preflight_status.

manuscript_blocks

block_id, section (Title/Abstract/Intro/Methods/Results/Discussion/…),

template_id, inputs_atom_ids[], rendered_text, lint_status.

This schema keeps everything equal and composable. It’s easy to query (“show me all E.roc used to satisfy G.items in Results”) and to audit.

3) Paper Algebra (𝒫‑Alg) — operators & rules

Let U be the set of atoms for a run. We define operators that transform sets of atoms deterministically:

Select / filter: σ_pred(U) → subset of atoms matching a predicate (e.g., σ_family=E ∧ type=calibration).

Project: π_fields(U) → keep only chosen fields (for tables/exports).

Join / link‑closure: U ⋈_role V → connect atoms via atom_links.role.

Map: map_f(U) → derive new atoms via pure function f (e.g., compute E.calibration.slope from predictions).

Reduce / fold: ⊕_{key}(U) → aggregate into a single atom/table (e.g., Table 1).

Cover: Cover(G, U) → minimal hitting set of atoms that witness all must requirements G.items.

Compose: Compose(template, inputs) → produce a manuscript_block deterministically.

Constrain: Constrain(U, C) → enforce equations/inequalities (e.g., 0≤ AUC ≤1, CI_low ≤ value ≤ CI_high).

Optimize: argmax_{Utility}(Plan(U)) under constraints (choose figures/actions that maximize Purpose utility with page/asset limits).

Normal forms

Guideline Normal Form (GNF): minimal atom set U* such that Cover(G, U*) satisfied for the chosen archetype.

Journal Normal Form (JNF): U* + assets reorganized/downsized to fit journal limits (columns, word count, figure caps).

Purpose Normal Form (PNF): JNF optimized for Purpose utility (e.g., add Decision Curve if clinical adoption is a goal).

4) Formula library (deterministic blueprints)

Each archetype has a small set of formulas mapping atoms → assets/sections.

Example — TRIPOD‑AI (prediction model)

Figures

F1 := ROC(σ_predictions(U))

F2 := PR(σ_predictions(U))

F3 := Calibration(σ_predictions(U)) with {slope,intercept,ci} constraints

F4 := DecisionCurve(σ_thresholds(U), outcomes) if Purpose includes adoption

Tables

T1 := Descriptives(⊕_{variable} σ_E.descriptives(U)) (Table 1)

T2 := PerformanceSummary({auc, auprc, brier, calibration})

Methods prose block

M := Compose("TRIPOD_Methods", {S.design, S.population, S.predictors, S.outcomes, S.validation_scheme, S.missing_data_strategy})

Results prose block

R := Compose("TRIPOD_Results", {T1,T2,F1,F2,F3,[F4]})

Guideline cover

Cover(TRIPOD-AI, U) must be true (proof via witness table).

Example — PRISMA (systematic review)

D1 := PRISMA_Flow(σ_included_studies(U))

F1 := Forest(σ_effects(U)) (+ funnel if bias_risk available)

T1 := RiskOfBias(σ_bias(U))

R := Compose("PRISMA_Results", {D1,F1,[Funnel],T1})

Cover(PRISMA, U) true.

These formulas are code: a registry of pure functions that take atoms and yield new atoms or assets.

5) Deterministic generation (LLM as constrained layer)

Compute atoms (study + evidence) → validate.

Satisfy guidelines by building a minimal covering set (GNF).

Fit journal (JNF) by applying sizing/limit transforms.

Optimize for purpose (PNF) with utility (e.g., choose DCA).

Render sections by Compose(template, inputs):

Templates are parameterized, lossless (no new facts).

The LLM (optional) rewrites sentences for clarity inside a sandbox:

Inputs: only the atoms used in that block.

Hard constraints: cannot invent atoms; must preserve numeric tokens and hedging rules; must pass a round‑trip parse back into the same atoms.

Guards: stats‑linter, consistency‑checker, claim–evidence round‑trip.

If the round‑trip parser can’t reconstruct the same atoms from the LLM text, reject and regenerate (or fall back to deterministic template prose).

6) Validation as algebraic proofs (publishability)

Every requirement becomes a proof obligation:

∀ r ∈ G.must: ∃ a ∈ U s.t. Witness(r, a) ∧ Validate(a)

JournalConformance(JournalSpec, U) (length, assets, style)

StatsCompliance(SAMPL, U) (effect sizes, CIs, assumptions, multiplicity, missing data)

Accessibility(PDF/UA, Assets)

Reproducibility(RunManifest, CAS) (recreate assets)

NarrativeConsistency(Blocks, ClaimGraph) (no contradictions, no orphan claims)

Originality(SimilarityCheck) within bounds

The system emits a certificate: a signed JSON with obligations[], witnesses[], and hashes of all assets.

7) Atomic constraints (selected)

Probability bounds: 0 ≤ AUC, AUPRC, Brier ≤ 1

Calibration: E.calibration.slope ≈ 1 ± ε, intercept ≈ 0 ± ε (report regardless of pass/fail)

CI ordering: ci_low ≤ value ≤ ci_high

CONSORT/PRISMA flows: counts conserved (enrolled = analyzed + excluded, etc.)

Table 1: sum(levels) == N, no suppressed PHI/PII fields

PDF: all figures embedded as vectors; each A.figure has non‑empty alt_text

Text: all numerics in prose must match source atoms within rounding tolerance

8) Minimal code artifacts you need

A. Data models (Pydantic)

Atom, AtomLink, Requirement, Witness, FigureSpec, ManuscriptBlock, JournalSpec, GuidelineSpec, PurposeSpec.

B. Algebra API

def select(atoms, **pred): ...
def cover(guideline, atoms) -> set[Atom]: ...
def compose(template_id, inputs: dict[str, Atom|list[Atom]]) -> ManuscriptBlock: ...
def validate_stats(atoms) -> list[Issue]: ...
def validate_figures(figs) -> list[Issue]: ...
def validate_pdf(pdf_path) -> list[Issue]: ...


C. Formula registry

REGISTRY = {
  "TRIPOD-AI": [roc_formula, pr_formula, calibration_formula, dca_formula, tripod_methods, tripod_results],
  "PRISMA":    [prisma_flow, forest, funnel_optional, bias_table, prisma_results],
  ...
}


D. Round‑trip parser (surface ↔ atoms)

Deterministic regex/grammar + JSON tags (<ATOM id="E.auc">0.86</ATOM>) during LLM drafting to make round‑trip exact; strip tags in final.

9) Example: end‑to‑end on one paragraph

Inputs (atoms)

E.roc.auc = 0.861 (95% CI: 0.842–0.880)
E.pr.auprc = 0.384 (95% CI: 0.355–0.416)
E.calibration.slope = 1.03 (0.98–1.08)
E.calibration.intercept = -0.01 (-0.03–0.01)


Template → deterministic text

The model achieved an AUROC of 0.861 (95% CI 0.842–0.880) and an AUPRC of 0.384 (95% CI 0.355–0.416). Calibration was adequate (slope 1.03 [0.98–1.08]; intercept −0.01 [−0.03–0.01]).

LLM (optional) rewrites for fluency; round‑trip parser re‑extracts the four values and checks equality within rounding tolerance. If any mismatch → reject.

10) How this makes the project 10× simpler

One representation (atoms) for everything → one storage, one audit trail.

Small operator set (select, cover, compose, validate) → easy to reason, easy to test.

Compact formula library per archetype → eliminates sprawling templates.

Determinism first; LLM only polishes under constraints → fewer hallucinations, easier debugging.

Proof‑carrying manuscripts (witnesses + certificates) → instant desk‑check readiness.

11) Validation program (atomic view)

Gates (all automated, human‑visible):

Ethics/registration satisfied (atoms S.ethics, S.registration_id verified).

Guideline coverage: Cover(G.primary, U) true; must=100%, should≥80%.

Journal conformance: JNF holds (word/asset/style).

Stats compliance (SAMPL): validate_stats(U) no critical issues.

Figures intent & accessibility: validate_figures(A.figure) all pass + alt_text.

PDF/UA + PDF/A: validate_pdf() passes.

Narrative integrity: no contradictions; no orphan claims in ClaimGraph.

Originality: similarity score adjudicated within limits.

Reproducibility: RunManifest + CAS hashes reproduce assets.

Output: submission_certificate.json with gate statuses, witnesses, and artifact hashes.

12) Initial build plan (focused, one sprint)

Week 1 — Spine

Implement Atom Store tables + models; CRUD + indexing.

Implement algebra operators (select, compose, cover) and validation scaffolds.

Seed TRIPOD‑AI formula set (ROC/PR/Calibration/DCA) and PRISMA (flow + forest).

Write figure renderers (PDF/SVG) + preflight (vector/contrast/fonts).

Week 2 — Proof & polish

Implement Cover() with verifiable requirements and witness table.

Implement stats‑linter (effect sizes, CIs, assumptions, multiplicity, missing data).

Add LaTeX → PDF/UA/A exporter with alt‑text injection.

Add round‑trip parser + constrained LLM wrapper.

Emit submission_certificate.json and purpose report.

Deliverable: deterministic, purpose‑aligned PDF (+ JATS optional) with atomic proofs that it meets guideline/journal/quality gates.

13) Quick reference — Atom field template

Excellent—here’s the “Coherency Pack”: the next, obvious set of precise, implementation‑ready artifacts that make the system fully consistent, robust, and complete. You can paste these into your repo today. They pin down vocabulary, storage, proof obligations, deterministic generation, and verification—so the pipeline behaves like math.

4) Paper‑Algebra DSL (YAML) for formulas

Use a tiny DSL to declare how atoms produce assets/blocks. The engine compiles this into functions.

# formulas/tripod_ai.yaml
archetype: prediction_model
guideline: tripod_ai
formulas:
  - id: roc
    inputs: [E.predictions, E.labels]
    outputs: [A.figure.roc_curve, E.roc.auc, E.roc.ci]
    compute:
      - op: roc_metrics
        args: {pred: E.predictions, label: E.labels, n_boot: 2000}
    validators: [auc_in_0_1, roc_monotone]
  - id: pr
    inputs: [E.predictions, E.labels]
    outputs: [A.figure.pr_curve, E.pr.auprc, E.pr.ci]
    compute:
      - op: pr_metrics
        args: {pred: E.predictions, label: E.labels, n_boot: 2000}
    validators: [auprc_in_0_1]
  - id: calibration
    inputs: [E.predictions, E.labels]
    outputs: [A.figure.calibration_curve, E.calibration.slope, E.calibration.intercept, E.calibration.ci]
    compute:
      - op: calibration
        args: {pred: E.predictions, label: E.labels, bins: 10, method: "loess"}
    validators: [prob_in_0_1, ci_order, has_slope_intercept]
  - id: decision_curve
    when: {purpose: "clinical_adoption"}
    inputs: [E.predictions, E.labels]
    outputs: [A.figure.decision_curve, E.net_benefit]
    compute:
      - op: decision_curve
        args: {thresholds: "0.01:0.01:0.99"}
    validators: [threshold_range]
blocks:
  - id: methods
    template: TRIPOD_Methods
    binds: [S.design, S.population, S.predictors, S.outcomes, S.validation_scheme, S.missing_data_strategy]
  - id: results
    template: TRIPOD_Results
    binds: [T1, T2, F.roc, F.pr, F.calibration, F.decision_curve?]


Add companion validators with the same IDs in author/viz/preflight.py.

5) Constrained LLM Protocol (LLM‑CLP) — round‑trip safe

Goal: LLM polishes style without altering facts. Protocol:

Input pack:

atoms[] (only the ones allowed for the block)

verbatim numerics (canonical strings for each numeric)

style hints (audience level, tense, hedging)

Inline tags (before final strip):

Wrap every numeric or fact with an atom tag:
This model achieved <ATOM id="E.roc.auc">0.861</ATOM> (95% CI <ATOM id="E.roc.ci.low">0.842</ATOM>–<ATOM id="E.roc.ci.high">0.880</ATOM>).

Rules the LLM must respect:

No new atoms; may reorder sentences and rephrase only.

Numeric tokens immutable (exact string) inside <ATOM> tags.

Hedging pattern: “suggests” for exploratory, “shows” for confirmatory.

Units & symbols from enum tables; no invented units.

Verification:

Parse back all <ATOM> tags and compare with source atoms (exact for strings, ± rounding tolerance for numerics).

Reject on mismatch; fall back to template prose.

Output:

Strip tags; store mapping in manuscript_blocks.inputs_atom_ids.

6) Numeric & Style Invariants (linters can enforce)

Rounding

AUROC/AUPRC/Brier: 3 decimals; CIs match same precision.

Effect sizes (RR/OR/HR): 2 decimals; p‑values to 3 decimals (or <0.001).

Percentages: 1 decimal unless N<100.

Consistency

CI ordering: low ≤ value ≤ high.

All probabilities in [0,1]; model predictions clipped then reported unchanged.

Sample sizes consistent across abstract ↔ results ↔ tables (sum checks).

Language

Avoid “significant” without context; prefer “statistically significant at α=…”.

Distinguish pre‑specified vs exploratory analyses.

Abstract contains: Background‑Methods‑Results‑Conclusion micro‑structure.

Put these rules in author/linters/style_stats.py.

7) Proof Obligations → Gate Checks (algorithms)

Guideline coverage

for req in requirements where guideline_id = primary:
    candidates = select(atoms, predicate=req.verify_spec.selector)
    verdict = any(predicate(c) for c in candidates)
    write witnesses(req, atom) with verdict
pass if all must_bool reqs verdict==pass and >=80% of should reqs pass


Journal conformance

Tokenize manuscript; count words/figures/tables; compare to JournalSpec caps.

Verify figure sizes; reference style via CSL.

Stats compliance

Scan manuscript_blocks + atoms for required effect_size + CI pairs; multiplicity section present if >1 primary endpoint; missing data strategy stated.

Figures intent

ROC monotonicity; calibration includes slope/intercept + CIs; decision‑curve thresholds in range; vector export; alt‑text non‑empty.

Accessibility

PDF tagged structure tree present; reading order linear; embedded fonts; alt‑text for each figure ID.

Originality

Ingest similarity report JSON; thresholds and human adjudication recorded.

Reproducibility

Re‑run figure generation with locked container; SHA‑256 match for vector outputs.

8) Submission Certificate (how you generate & verify)

Generation

Collect gate outcomes (pass/fail/waived + reasons).

Attach witness table (only passing entries).

Attach artifact hashes (PDF/UA, PDF/A, JATS).

Compute certificate hash over canonical JSON.

Sign with service key; store in CAS and DB.

Verification CLI

pe verify cert.json \
  --pdf-ua outputs/paper_ua.pdf \
  --pdf-a outputs/paper_a.pdf \
  --jats outputs/article.xml \
  --atoms db://runs/<id>/atoms
# Exit 0 if and only if all hashes match and all gates pass (waivers require approver sig).

9) Golden Mini‑Corpus (starter set with oracles)

Ship 4 tiny, deterministic examples:

TRIPOD‑AI: synthetic binary classification; expected AUROC/AUPRC, calibration slope/intercept; ROC/PR/Cal/DCA figures and text snippets with exact numbers.

PRISMA: toy meta‑analysis (5 studies); PRISMA flow counts; forest plot with fixed random‑effects numbers.

CONSORT: mock 2‑arm RCT with flow counts; baseline table; primary outcome CI.

STARD: diagnostic 2×2 table; ROC and decision threshold table.

For each: include atoms.jsonl, expected_fig_sha256.json, expected_blocks.txt, expected_certificate.json.

10) Plugin Service Provider Interfaces (SPIs)

Guideline plugin

class GuidelinePlugin(Protocol):
    id: str
    applies_to: list[str]              # archetypes or designs
    def checklist(self) -> list[Requirement]: ...
    def verify(self, atom: dict, req: Requirement) -> bool: ...


Journal plugin

class JournalPlugin(Protocol):
    id: str
    def spec(self) -> dict: ...        # JournalSpec
    def quirks(self) -> dict: ...      # e.g., figure widths, bib style keys


Chart renderer plugin

class ChartPlugin(Protocol):
    type: str
    def validate_spec(self, spec: dict) -> list[str]: ...
    def render(self, spec: dict, df: DataFrame, outdir: str) -> dict: ... # returns file hashes


Register via entry points or an internal registry; load only from signed packages to keep the KB trustworthy.

11) Error Taxonomy (uniform, machine‑actionable)
Code	Layer	Meaning	Default action

OPS/HASH	ops	artifact hash mismatch (non‑determinism)	block; rerun locked env
12) “Next PRs” checklist (so you can ship this week)

 Add enums.py and schemas/ from this message.

 Create DDL migration with the Atom Store tables and indexes.

 Implement formula loader (YAML → Python call graph).

 Add LLM‑CLP wrapper with <ATOM> tagging + round‑trip verifier.

 Implement stats/style linter with the rounding/wording rules above.

 Emit submission_certificate.json and pe verify CLI.

 Seed golden mini‑corpus and wire into CI.

Why this content is “the next obvious step”

You already have architecture, purpose, algebra, and pipelines. What remained ambiguous was types, storage, proofs, and round‑trip determinism.

These artifacts close the loop: they unify vocabulary, lock consistency, mathematically constrain generation, and prove publishability—turning the system from an idea into a verifiable machine.

If you want, I can generate ready‑to‑commit files (/schemas/*.json, /migrations/*.sql, /formulas/tripod_ai.yaml, a skeleton pe verify CLI) matching exactly what’s above.

Fantastic—here’s the Next‑Obvious Content Pack (v1.0): a set of ready‑to‑commit files that add the missing glue for coherency, robustness, and true completeness. These nail the last ambiguities—templates, proofs, validators, round‑trip safety, accessibility tagging, and runbooks—so your pipeline behaves deterministically end‑to‑end.

How to use this answer
Copy the blocks into your repo using the suggested paths. Nothing here is toy text; every item aligns with the atom model, paper‑algebra, gates, and state machine we already defined.

1) Compose Templates Pack (Jinja2) — deterministic prose blocks

templates/Title.jinja

{# Inputs: S.design, S.outcomes[0].name, S.population.setting, PurposeSpec.primary_purpose #}
{{ S.outcomes[0].name | title }} in {{ S.population.setting | title }}:
A {{ S.design | replace("_"," ") }} Study
{% if PurposeSpec.primary_purpose == "publish_in_target_venue" %}{% endif %}


templates/Abstract_structured.jinja

{# Inputs: S.*, E.* key metrics; 150–250 words target #}
Background: {{ R.claim.background }}
Methods: We conducted a {{ S.design | replace("_"," ") }} using {{ S.data_source }} ({{ S.period }}). The primary outcome was {{ S.outcomes[0].name }}.
Results: The model achieved an AUROC of <ATOM id="E.roc.auc">{{ E.roc.auc | fmt3 }}</ATOM> (95% CI <ATOM id="E.roc.ci.low">{{ E.roc.ci[0] | fmt3 }}</ATOM>–<ATOM id="E.roc.ci.high">{{ E.roc.ci[1] | fmt3 }}</ATOM>)
and an AUPRC of <ATOM id="E.pr.auprc">{{ E.pr.auprc | fmt3 }}</ATOM> (95% CI <ATOM id="E.pr.ci.low">{{ E.pr.ci[0] | fmt3 }}</ATOM>–<ATOM id="E.pr.ci.high">{{ E.pr.ci[1] | fmt3 }}</ATOM>).
Calibration: slope <ATOM id="E.cal.slope">{{ E.calibration.slope | fmt2 }}</ATOM>, intercept <ATOM id="E.cal.intercept">{{ E.calibration.intercept | fmt2sign }}</ATOM>.
Conclusions: {{ R.claim.conclusion }} {{ R.caveat }}


templates/Methods_TRIPOD_AI.jinja

{# Inputs: S.design, S.population, S.predictors, S.outcomes, S.validation_scheme, S.missing_data_strategy, S.ethics #}
Study design and setting: {{ S.design | replace("_"," ") }} in {{ S.population.setting }} ({{ S.period }}).
Participants: {{ S.population.description }}; inclusion criteria: {{ S.inclusion_criteria }}.
Predictors and outcome: Predictors included {{ S.predictors | list_csv }}; the outcome was {{ S.outcomes[0].name }}.
Sample size and missing data: {{ S.sample_size }} participants; missing data handled via {{ S.missing_data_strategy }}.
Model development and validation: {{ S.validation_scheme }} with prespecified hyperparameters ({{ S.hyperparams }}).
Ethics: {{ S.ethics.statement }}; registration {{ S.registration_id or "N/A" }}.


templates/Results_TRIPOD_AI.jinja

{# Inputs: T1 (descriptives), T2 (performance), F_roc, F_pr, F_cal, F_dca? #}
Cohort characteristics are summarized in Table 1.
Discrimination: AUROC <ATOM id="E.roc.auc">{{ E.roc.auc | fmt3 }}</ATOM> (95% CI <ATOM id="E.roc.ci.low">{{ E.roc.ci[0] | fmt3 }}</ATOM>–<ATOM id="E.roc.ci.high">{{ E.roc.ci[1] | fmt3 }}</ATOM>); AUPRC <ATOM id="E.pr.auprc">{{ E.pr.auprc | fmt3 }}</ATOM>.
Calibration: slope <ATOM id="E.cal.slope">{{ E.calibration.slope | fmt2 }}</ATOM>, intercept <ATOM id="E.cal.intercept">{{ E.calibration.intercept | fmt2sign }}</ATOM> (Figure {{ A.figure.calibration_curve.label }}).
{% if A.figure.decision_curve %}Clinical utility: Decision curves show net benefit across thresholds relevant to deployment (Figure {{ A.figure.decision_curve.label }}).{% endif %}


templates/Discussion_generic.jinja

Principal findings: {{ R.claim.main_result }}.
Comparison with prior work: {{ R.claim.context }}.
Limitations: {{ R.limitation }}; generalizability: {{ R.generalizability }}.

templates/Statements_*.jinja

DataAvailability.jinja, CodeAvailability.jinja, Ethics.jinja, CRediT.jinja, Conflicts.jinja, Funding.jinja – each just interpolates the corresponding P‑atoms (policy atoms).

These templates are lossless: every numeric is tagged with <ATOM …> for round‑trip checking (see §4).

2) Formula Registry (DSL) — CONSORT & PRISMA added

  ]
}

4) LLM‑CLP (Constrained Language Protocol) — prompt & verifier

author/llm/clp_prompt.md

SYSTEM:
You are a scientific copy editor. You MUST preserve all content inside <ATOM id="...">...</ATOM> tags EXACTLY.
Do not create new facts or numbers. You may change word order and connective phrases only.

STYLE:
- Audience: {{ audience }}
- Tense: past for Methods/Results; present for Conclusions.
- Hedging: "suggests" for exploratory; "shows" for pre-registered confirmatory.

INPUT:
- Allowed atoms (JSON): {{ atoms_json }}
- Draft block (Jinja-rendered with ATOM tags): <<BLOCK_START>>
{{ rendered_text_with_tags }}
<<BLOCK_END>>

OUTPUT:
Return only the edited block, keeping <ATOM> tags unchanged.


author/llm/roundtrip_grammar.ebnf

Block      = { Segment } ;
Segment    = AtomTag | Text ;
AtomTag    = "<ATOM id=\"" AtomId "\">" AtomValue "</ATOM>" ;
AtomId     = ? [A-Za-z0-9._-] + ? ;
AtomValue  = { ? any char except '<' ? } ;
Text       = { ? any char ? } ;


Verifier (spec):

Parse all AtomTags; for each id, compare AtomValue to the source atom string (exact).

Fail if: added/removed AtomTag; AtomValue mismatch; or any number in Text doesn’t match a known source atom for that block.

5) Alt‑Text Templates (per chart type)

author/viz/alt_text_templates.yaml

roc_curve: >
  Receiver operating characteristic curves comparing models; area under the curve is {{ E.roc.auc | fmt3 }}
  with 95% CI {{ E.roc.ci[0] | fmt3 }}–{{ E.roc.ci[1] | fmt3 }}. Higher curves indicate better discrimination.

pr_curve: >
  Precision–recall curves with AUPRC {{ E.pr.auprc | fmt3 }} (95% CI {{ E.pr.ci[0] | fmt3 }}–{{ E.pr.ci[1] | fmt3 }}).
  Useful for imbalanced outcomes.

calibration_curve: >
  Calibration plot showing predicted vs observed risk; slope {{ E.calibration.slope | fmt2 }},
  intercept {{ E.calibration.intercept | fmt2sign }}; bands denote uncertainty.

decision_curve: >
  Decision-curve analysis showing net benefit across thresholds from {{ thresholds.min }} to {{ thresholds.max }};
  the "treat all" and "treat none" strategies are included for reference.

consort_flow: >
  CONSORT flow diagram summarizing participants: {{ counts.enrolled }} enrolled, {{ counts.analyzed }} analyzed,
  with reasons for exclusions.

prisma_flow: >
  PRISMA flow diagram: {{ counts.records_identified }} records identified, {{ counts.included }} studies included.

forest_plot: >
  Forest plot of study-level effect sizes with confidence intervals; diamond indicates pooled estimate.

8) Error Messages & Remediation (uniform)

ops/errors.yaml

PRIVACY/PII:
  message: "Detected personally identifiable information in inputs."
  remediation: ["Redact fields: {{ hits }}", "Re-run privacy scan", "Escalate if clinical identifiers required"]

9) Golden Mini‑Corpus (starter data)

golden/tripod_ai/atoms.jsonl

{"atom_id":"E.roc.auc","family":"E","type":"roc","subtype":"auc","value_json":{"value":0.861,"ci":[0.842,0.880]},"units":"unitless","snapshot_id":"dev","created_by":"seed","privacy":"none","criticality":"must","validation_status":"pass"}
{"atom_id":"E.pr.auprc","family":"E","type":"pr","subtype":"auprc","value_json":{"value":0.384,"ci":[0.355,0.416]},"units":"unitless","snapshot_id":"dev","created_by":"seed","privacy":"none","criticality":"must","validation_status":"pass"}
{"atom_id":"E.calibration.slope","family":"E","type":"calibration","subtype":"slope","value_json":{"value":1.03,"ci":[0.98,1.08]},"units":"unitless","snapshot_id":"dev","created_by":"seed","privacy":"none","criticality":"must","validation_status":"pass"}

golden/prisma/atoms.jsonl (tiny example)

{"atom_id":"S.screening.counts","family":"S","type":"screening_counts","subtype":"prisma","value_json":{"records_identified":1200,"records_screened":900,"full_text_assessed":120,"included":12},"snapshot_id":"dev","created_by":"seed","privacy":"none","criticality":"must","validation_status":"pass"}

10) Deterministic Number Formatting Helpers (spec)

author/filters/formatters.py (design notes)

fmt3(x): round half‑up to 3 decimals; always 3 places (0.861).

fmt2(x): 2 decimals; fmt2sign(x) adds explicit sign (-0.01).

Never locale‑dependent commas; non‑breaking spaces between number and unit.

Canonical strings emitted here become the only allowed AtomValue for round‑trip checks.

11) CI Pipeline Skeleton

.ci/pipeline.yaml

name: paper-engine-ci
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with: { python-version: '3.11' }
      - run: pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
      - run: pytest -q
      - run: python tools/validate_schemas.py schemas/
      - run: python tools/run_golden.py golden/ --strict
      - run: python tools/check_pdfua.py outputs/golden/*.pdf
      - run: python tools/check_jats.py outputs/golden/*.xml

12) Operational Runbooks (short, actionable)

ops/runbooks/PDFUA_FAIL.md

Symptoms: CI step 'check_pdfua' fails.
Checks:
 1. Are figure alt-texts non-empty? (search 'A.figure.*.alt_text')
 2. Are fonts embedded? (pdffonts output)
 3. Is tagging_map.yaml aligned with sections present?
Actions:
 - Re-run 'format.latex.tagpdf' with --repair-reading-order
 - If still failing, open the PDF in PAC 202x and fix the failing tags; update tagpdf module accordingly.


ops/runbooks/CONTRADICTION_FOUND.md

Symptoms: author.contradiction.validate reports mismatch.
Checks:
 - Show diff of abstract vs results numbers (script: tools/numdiff.py)
Actions:
 - Regenerate the offending block with LLM-CLP
 - If numbers differ in atoms, fix the source atom and propagate

13) Security Policies (PII/PHI guard)

privacy/policy.yaml

mode: "block"   # block | redact | allow
patterns:
  phi:
    - "(?i)MRN:\\s*[A-Z0-9-]+"
    - "(?i)SSN:\\s*\\d{3}-\\d{2}-\\d{4}"
    - "(?i)Full Name:\\s*[A-Za-z ,.'-]{3,}"
  quasi:
    - "\\b\\d{5}\\b"   # zip code
    - "\\b\\d{4}-\\d{2}-\\d{2}\\b" # dates of birth
actions:
  block_if: ["phi"]
  redact_if: ["quasi"]
audit:
  log_hits: true
  preserve_snippets: false

14) Purpose Presets & Utility Weights

purpose/presets.yaml

publish_flagship:
  success_metrics:
    acceptance_probability: 0.40
    stats_quality: 0.20
    journal_conformance: 0.15
    accessibility: 0.10
    reproducibility: 0.10
    originality: 0.05
  invariants: ["no_phi_in_outputs","external_validation_required"]
impact_first:
  success_metrics:
    clinical_utility_proof: 0.30
    external_validation_presence: 0.20
    clarity_score: 0.20
    reproducibility: 0.15
    coverage_score: 0.15
  invariants: ["no_phi_in_outputs"]

15) Contribution & Snapshot Governance

docs/KB_SNAPSHOTS.md

- Every change to guidelines/journals/templates creates a new snapshot id.
- Attach manifest with source URLs and SHA-256 hashes.
- CI validates that coverage maps still pass for the golden corpus.
- No direct edits to previous snapshots; additive only.

Why this pack is the “next obvious step”

Coherency: unified enums, templates, coverage maps, and a formula DSL make every pipeline decision reproducible and inspectable.

Robustness: round‑trip‑safe LLM protocol, stats/intent linters, PDF tagging map, and explicit error remediation remove the wiggle room that causes regressions.

Completeness: CONSORT/PRISMA formulas, golden mini‑corpus, runbooks, CI skeleton, and submission certificate structure finish the loop from atoms → proofs → accessible, journal‑ready PDFs.

If you want, I can auto‑generate the folder/file tree with these contents and stub Python loaders so your team can git add and run the golden cases immediately.

WHAT THE NEXT NOT-SO-OBVIOUS CONTENT YOU MUST PROVIDE IN ORDER TO ADD COHERENCY, ROBUSTNESS AND TRUE COMPLETENESS OF OUR SYSTEM??

Reasoned for 9m 45s

Love it. Here’s the Not‑So‑Obvious Content Pack (v1.0)—the pieces teams usually miss, but which make the whole system coherent, robust, and truly complete. Everything below is implementation‑ready: file names, data shapes, rules, and short code/pseudocode stubs that drop cleanly into the architecture you already have.

1) Static Atom Type System + Effect Rules (LLM cannot invent facts)

Why: If “everything is an atom,” we need compile‑time guarantees that atoms compose correctly and that generation can’t introduce new facts.

Files

types/atom_types.yaml — kinds & subtypes

types/typing_rules.yaml — what composes with what

author/llm/effects.yaml — what a writer is allowed to do

  E: {desc: "Evidence atoms"}       # auc, auprc, effects, ci, etc.
  G: {desc: "Guideline atoms"}
  R: {desc: "Rhetorical atoms"}     # claims, limitations
  A: {desc: "Asset atoms"}          # figures/tables/diagrams

  E.calibration.intercept: {base: float}
  E.effect_size.or:  {base: float, range: [0.01, 100.0]}
  S.design:          {base: enum, values: [randomized, cohort, case_control, cross_sectional, diagnostic, prediction, meta_analysis, animal, economic]}
  A.figure.roc_curve:{base: figure}
  P.authors_credit:  {base: credit_roles}
  ...


types/typing_rules.yaml (excerpts)

rules:
  - name: "ROC needs predictions + labels"
    requires: [{kind: E, type: predictions}, {kind: E, type: labels}]
    produces: [{kind: A, type: figure, subtype: roc_curve}, {kind: E, type: roc, subtype: auc}]

effects:
  surface_realization:
    can_reorder_sentences: true
    can_rephrase: true

    can_change_numbers: false        # numbers anchor to <ATOM> tags
    can_add_new_facts: false
    must_keep_units: true


Static checker stub (types/typecheck.py)

def typecheck(plan, atoms, typing_rules):
    for step in plan:
        check_requirements(step, atoms, typing_rules)
        enforce_constraints(step, atoms)
    return True

2) Units & Dimensional Analysis (no more mg/dL vs mmol/L mistakes)

Files

units/base_units.yaml, units/clinical_conversions.yaml

validators/dimension_check.py

units/clinical_conversions.yaml (snippet)

glucose:
  from: mg/dL
  to:   mmol/L
  factor: 0.0555
cholesterol:
  from: mg/dL
  to:   mmol/L
  factor: 0.0259
odds_ratio:
  unit: unitless
probability:
  unit: 1


Dimension validator idea

def ensure_unit(atom, expected_unit):
    u = atom.value_json.get("unit", expected_unit)
    if u != expected_unit: atom = convert(atom, u, expected_unit)
    return atom

3) Numerics Canonicalization & Tolerances (one string to rule them all)

Files

numerics/canonical_policy.yaml

numerics/tolerances.yaml

numerics/canon.py

numerics/canonical_policy.yaml

rounding:
  auc: 3
  auprc: 3
  effect_size: 2
  p_value: 3
tie_breaker: half_away_from_zero   # deterministic
thousand_sep: none
sign_policy: explicit_for_signed   # e.g., -0.01


numerics/tolerances.yaml

roc_auc: {abs: 1e-4}
cal_slope: {abs: 1e-3}
intercept: {abs: 1e-3}


Canon function

def canon_number(x, kind):  # returns canonical string
    cfg = POLICY[kind]; s = round_with_policy(x, cfg)
    return s

4) Provenance Ledger (W3C‑PROV‑like, tamper‑evident)

Files

prov/schema.json, prov/emit.py, ops/audit_chain.py

Core idea: Every atom E references:

entity: the dataset slice + code commit

activity: operation (e.g., roc_metrics@a1b2c3)

agent: user/service identity
Chain with hashes: each event stores prev_hash to make tampering detectable.

5) Adversarial & Red‑Team Suite (break it before reviewers do)

Files

redteam/scenarios.yaml

redteam/mutators.py

redteam/checks.py

redteam/scenarios.yaml

format/layout_profiles.yaml (column widths, font sizes, figure widths)

planner/morphology.py (transform outline between venues without losing atoms)

How to integrate (2‑day plan)

Day 1

Add atom type system, numerics canon, units, provenance ledger, and LLM effect rules.

Wire numdiff and nondet_scan into CI.

Day 2

Add adversarial suite, metric anti‑patterns, waiver governance, and venue crosswalk.

Ship submission & revision templates and the graphical abstract generator.

Why these are “not‑so‑obvious” but critical

They close silent failure modes (unit drift, LLM fact injection, metric misuse, nondeterminism).

They prove trust (provable provenance + certificates + governance).

They speed iteration (MPA rules, venue morphology, red‑team scenarios).

They scale globally (multilingual CLP, licensing/IP, fairness & harms).

If you want, I can generate the actual folder/file tree with stub code for these modules so your team can commit and pass CI on a skeleton within a single working session.

WHAT ARE THE NEXT NOT-SO-OBVIOUS CONTENT YOU MUST PROVIDE IN ORDER TO ADD COHERENCY, ROBUSTNESS AND TRUE COMPLETENESS OF OUR SYSTEM??
ChatGPT said:
Request for GPT-5 Pro
Reasoned for 6m 24s

Outstanding question. Here’s the Not‑So‑Obvious Content Pack v1.2—the next layer of glue that teams usually overlook, but which materially boosts coherency, robustness, and true completeness. Everything is implementation‑ready: file paths, formats, and minimal code/specs you can paste into the repo you’ve been shaping.

This pack deepens: claims discipline (causal language), rule conflicts, provable constraints, coverage optimality, citation adequacy, researcher‑degrees‑of‑freedom auditing, authorship fairness, regulatory & ethics add‑ons, reproducibility hardening, and venue transfer—all wired to the atom model and paper‑algebra.

1) Causal‑Language Guard (design‑licensed rhetoric)

Why: Prevents accidental causal claims from observational/prediction designs.

Files

rhetoric/claim_lexicon.yaml

rhetoric/claim_validator.py

rhetoric/claim_lexicon.yaml

design_licenses:
  randomized: {allow: ["cause", "effect of", "reduces", "increases"], hedge: ["suggests"], forbid: []}
  cohort:     {allow: ["associated with", "linked to"], forbid: ["cause", "effect of"]}
  case_control:{allow: ["associated with"], forbid: ["cause", "effect of"]}
  prediction: {allow: ["predicts", "discriminates", "calibrates"], forbid: ["improves outcome", "reduces risk"]} 
  diagnostic: {allow: ["diagnostic accuracy", "sensitivity/specificity"], forbid: ["improves survival"]}
rules:
  - when: "design in {cohort, case_control} and text contains any('cause','effect of')"
    action: "flag"
  - when: "design == prediction and text contains any('reduces','improves outcome')"
    action: "flag"


Hook: run claim_validator.validate(manuscript_blocks) in the S11 CONSISTENT state; annotate redlines where language violates license.

2) Guideline Conflict Resolution & Precedence

Why: Different rules (e.g., TRIPOD‑AI + SAGER + TIDieR) can collide. Make precedence explicit.

Files

rules/conflicts.yaml

rules/conflict_resolver.py

rules/conflicts.yaml

precedence: ["ethics", "icmje", "consort|prisma|stard|tripod_ai", "strobe", "arrive", "cheers", "care", "tidi er", "sager"]
rewrites:
  - conflict: "TRIPOD-AI calibration vs. journal's 'no equations'"
    resolution: "textualize calibration; keep slope/intercept in Results table"
  - conflict: "Nature summary vs. word limit"
    resolution: "move detail to Reporting Summary; abstract stays within limit"


Resolver: merges coverage maps; tags “waivable” items; produces a single effective requirement set used by Cover().

3) Constraint Engine (math‑first; optional SMT bridge)

Why: Turn invariants into machine‑checked constraints (counts conserve, ranges, CI order).

Files

constraints/dsl.yaml (declarative)

constraints/engine.py (Python evaluator)

constraints/smt_bridge.py (optional, for Z3/OR‑Tools)

constraints/dsl.yaml

constraints:
  - id: ci_order
    selector: {"family":"E","type":"*"}
    expr: "ci[0] <= value <= ci[1]"
  - id: prob_bounds
    selector: {"family":"E","type":"predictions","subtype":"probability"}
    expr: "forall(p in values): 0 <= p <= 1"
  - id: consort_counts
    selector: {"family":"S","type":"participant_counts"}
    expr: "enrolled == analyzed + excluded"


Engine call: engine.check(atoms, dsl) -> issues[]. Failures block S6/S8.

4) Cover() as Minimal Hitting Set (provable optimality)

Why: Ensure you produce the smallest sufficient set of atoms/assets to satisfy guidelines (keeps papers tight).

Files

cover/min_hitting_set.py (greedy + exact fallback)

tests/property/test_cover_minimality.py

Greedy idea (with exact fallback for small N):

def minimal_cover(requirements, candidates, witnesses):
    # candidates: atoms/assets with the reqs they can satisfy
    cover, uncovered = set(), set(r.req_id for r in requirements)
    while uncovered:
        best = max(candidates, key=lambda c: len(c.reqs & uncovered))
        cover.add(best); uncovered -= best.reqs
        candidates.remove(best)
        if not candidates and uncovered: raise RuntimeError("No cover")
    return cover


Property test: removing any element from cover breaks coverage.

5) Citation Adequacy & “Prior Work Gap” Detector

Why: Desk rejections often cite poor positioning. Detect missing seminal or required comparisons.

Files

citation/coverage_targets.yaml

citation/gap_finder.py

citation/coverage_targets.yaml

prediction_model:
  must_cover:
    - topic: "baseline logistic regression"
      reason: "benchmark"
    - topic: "external validation literature"
      reason: "scope positioning"
diagnostic_accuracy:
  must_cover:
    - topic: "STARD seminal paper"
systematic_review:
  must_cover:
    - topic: "prior meta-analyses on same question"


Gap finder: map your references (titles/abstracts/keywords from Crossref metadata) → topics via embeddings/keyword rules; flag uncovered topics and suggest 3 candidate DOIs.

6) Researcher‑Degrees‑of‑Freedom (RDoF) Audit

Why: Catch p‑hacking/QRPs early; make transparency explicit.

Files

rdof/checklist.yaml

rdof/audit.py

rdof/checklist.yaml

choices:
  thresholds: {reported: "yes/no", declared_criteria: "pre/post"}
  feature_selection: {method: ["manual","auto","none"], time: ["pre","post"]}
  multiple_models: {tried: "int", selection_rule: "AIC/BIC/val-metric/pre-registered"}
  missing_data: {method: ["complete-case","imputation"], details: "text"}
gates:
  - require: "selection_rule != '' when multiple_models.tried > 1"
  - flag: "thresholds.declared_criteria == 'post'"


Output: an RDoF appendix atom with structured declarations + flags; referenced in Methods.

7) Authorship Fairness & CRediT Audit

Why: Align contributions with author order; reduce disputes.

Files

credit/order_rules.yaml

credit/validator.py

credit/order_rules.yaml

first_author_requires: ["Conceptualization","Methodology","Writing-Original-Draft"]
last_author_requires:  ["Supervision","Funding acquisition"]
equal_contrib_tag: "†"


Validator: checks CRediT atoms vs order; emits warnings + suggested footnotes.

8) Regulatory & Policy Add‑Ons (SaMD/clinical AI)

Why: If the paper implies clinical deployment, add the right disclosures.

Files

regulatory/samd_checklist.yaml

regulatory/impact_statement.jinja

regulatory/samd_checklist.yaml

items:
  - "intended use and clinical workflow position"
  - "human oversight plan"
  - "dataset shift and update policy"
  - "post-market performance monitoring"
gates:
  - require_when: "purpose includes 'clinical_adoption'"

9) Differential Privacy & Small‑Cell Suppression (optional but powerful)

Why: Prevent re‑identification in tables/appendices.

Files

privacy/dp_policy.yaml

privacy/dp_release.py

privacy/dp_policy.yaml

small_cell_threshold: 5
dp:
  enabled: false
  epsilon_total: 2.0
  mechanisms:
    - table1_counts: laplace(epsilon: 0.5)


Behavior: apply suppression/noise to descriptive tables when policy enabled; tag affected atoms.

10) Compute Footprint & Sustainability Statement

Why: Increasingly requested; good optics and transparency.

Files

sustainability/footprint.py

sustainability/statement.jinja

footprint.py records GPU/CPU hours, TDP estimates → kgCO₂e; generate a short statement linked to the RunManifest.

11) Similarity vs. Paraphrase Drift (beyond percent overlap)

Why: Guard against semantic plagiarism and over‑aggressive paraphrasing.

Files

originality/semantic_diff.py

Idea: compute sentence‑level embedding similarity to top‑N overlaps; flag sections with near‑identity semantics but paraphrased wording without attribution; force explicit quotes/citations.

12) Venue Transfer Paths & Morphology Rules

Why: Fast re‑targeting after editorial rejection (common IRL).

Files

rules/transfer_paths.yaml

planner/morphology.py (uses your crosswalk)

transfer_paths.yaml

nature-medicine:
  fallbacks: ["lancet-digital-health","npj-digital-medicine","scientific-reports"]
ieee-tmi:
  fallbacks: ["tbme","jbhi"]


Morphology: compress/expand sections to new caps; rewrite reference style; re‑size figures to new column widths—without touching atoms.

13) Cohort Validity & Data Integrity Invariants

Why: Guard against silent sample construction bugs.

Files

cohort/validators.yaml

cohort/checks.py

validators.yaml

rules:
  - "N == sum(level_counts) in Table1"
  - "lost_to_followup + completed + withdrawn == enrolled"
  - "index_date <= outcome_date for all records"
  - "no duplicate primary_key"

14) Outlier & Anomaly Policy (pre‑registered)

Why: Make exclusion rules explicit; avoid hindsight bias.

Files

data/anomaly_policy.yaml

data/anomaly_detection.py

Policy: define detection method (IQR/robust z) + action (winsorize/exclude/flag). Emit an exclusion CONSORT‑style mini‑flow.

15) “Equation of Record” Library (metric definitions)

Why: Eliminates subtle metric discrepancies across contributors.

Files

metrics/equations.md (explicit formulas, integration method for AUPRC, CI computation details)

metrics/reference_impl/ (unit‑tested functions)

16) Multilingual CLP (LLM‑CLP‑X) & Controlled Glossaries

Why: Publish or preprint in multiple languages without numeric drift.

Files

author/llm/clp_multilingual.md

glossaries/*.yaml

author/llm/backtranslate_check.py

Rule: if bilingual output produced, back‑translate and run num‑diff vs atoms.

17) Incident Response & Integrity Runbooks

Why: When a gate fails in production or a post‑publication correction is needed.

Files

ops/runbooks/INCIDENT_INTEGRITY.md

ops/correction_workflow.md (atoms → updated blocks → new PDF & erratum)

18) Non‑Determinism & Idempotency Hardening

Why: Exact reproducibility across nodes/runs.

Files

ops/idempotency.md (idempotency keys per step)

ops/nondet_scan.py (run thrice; hash‑compare vector assets; gate if drift > ε)

19) Human‑in‑the‑Loop Accountability Ledger

Why: Record who overrode/waived what, and why.

Files

governance/approvals_ledger.md (format)

governance/approvals.jsonl (append‑only; signed entries)

Entry fields: gate, decision, approver_id, public_key_sig, delta_utility, justification.

20) “Minimum Publishable Action” (MPA) Plug‑in (impact optimizer)

Why: In tight timelines, recommend the single highest‑ROI analysis that lifts acceptance likelihood.

Files

planner/mpa_rules.yaml

planner/mpa.py

Rule example

tripod_ai:
  - if: "no_external_validation"
    then: {action: "external_validation_temporal", delta_accept: 0.12, cost_hours: 24}

Integration Checklist (fast path)

Drop in: rhetoric/, rules/conflicts.yaml, constraints/, cover/, citation/coverage_targets.yaml, rdof/, credit/.

Wire gates:

S11 add claim_validator, semantic_diff.

S6/ S8 add constraints.engine, cohort/checks.

S10 add rdof/audit, credit/validator.

Planner: enable mpa.py and transfer_paths.

Format: include sustainability and regulatory statements when triggered.

Ops: enable idempotency keys + nondeterminism scan; append approvals ledger.

Why these are the right “not‑so‑obvious” pieces

Coherency: Causal‑language licensing + conflict precedence ensures your narrative, rules, and venue constraints never disagree.

Robustness: Constraint engine, minimal cover proofs, cohort/data integrity, nondeterminism scan—all make failures visible and actionable.

True completeness: Prior‑work coverage, RDoF audit, authorship fairness, regulatory/sustainability add‑ons, and venue transfer paths reflect how real submissions succeed (or fail) in practice.

If you want, I can generate a patch set (folders + starter files for each item above) so your repo compiles and the new gates appear in your CI immediately.

ChatGPT said:

Reasoned for 5m 10s

Phenomenal—let’s ship the Not‑Obvious‑At‑All Content Pack (v2.0): the deep, esoteric glue that serious systems need but most teams never specify. Everything below is implementation‑ready: file paths, schemas, rules, and minimal code stubs. Drop these into your repo to materially increase coherency, robustness, and true completeness.

0) What this pack covers (why it’s “not‑obvious‑at‑all”)

Formal semantics (so the paper‑algebra can be proved correct).

Bitemporal truth & audit (what was true vs when you knew it).

Delta‑aware, monotonic builds (idempotent, incremental recompute).

Metamorphic testing (oracle‑free, property‑based checks).

Hard LLM containment (prompt injection defenses with contracts).

Causal‑language licensing, spin detectors, and semantic plagiarism.

Data drift, shift & contestability (counterfactuals, “unknown unknowns”).

Privacy, residency, right‑to‑be‑forgotten that still keeps proofs valid.

Structural PDF equivalence (hash‑stable proofs even when PDF bytes differ).

Tenancy, governance, waivers, and regulated deployment add‑ons.

Everything ties back to your atom model and Purpose‑first state machine.

1) Formal Semantics for Paper‑Algebra (𝒫‑Alg)

Files

semantics/palg_spec.md — denotational semantics

semantics/contracts.yaml — Hoare‑style function specs

semantics/proofs_sanity.md — obligations + how to test them

semantics/palg_spec.md (excerpt)

Universe 𝕌 is the set of atoms produced within a run r.

Denotation ⟦·⟧:
  ⟦select P⟧(𝕌)         = { a ∈ 𝕌 | P(a) = true }
  ⟦project F⟧(X)         = { a|F for a ∈ X }
  ⟦join_R⟧(X,Y)          = { (a,b) | a∈X,b∈Y,(a,b,R)∈atom_links }
  ⟦map_f⟧(X)             = { f(a) | a ∈ X }  (f must be pure, total)
  ⟦cover(G)⟧(𝕌)          = argmin_C⊆𝕌  s.t.  ∀req∈Req(G): ∃a∈C with Witness(req,a)
  ⟦compose T⟧(I)         = render_T(I)  (deterministic; round‑trip parsable)
  ⟦constrain C⟧(X)       = X if ∀a∈X: C(a) else ⊥
  ⟦optimize U,B⟧(Plans)  = argmax_{p∈Plans, cost(p)≤B} U(p)
Properties:
  Monotonicity: select, project, join are monotone; map_f monotone if f is monotone.
  Idempotence: select∘select = select; project∘project = project.
  Purity: All ⟦·⟧ are pure wrt 𝕌 (no hidden state).


semantics/contracts.yaml (examples)

- fn: cover
  pre:  "∀req ∈ Req(G): ∃a ∈ 𝕌: candidate(req,a)"
  post: "∀req: satisfied(req, result) ∧ minimal(result)"
- fn: compose
  pre:  "inputs ⊆ 𝕌 ∧ template_exists(id)"
  post: "roundtrip(parse(render)) == inputs"

2) Bitemporal Atom Store (valid‑time vs system‑time)

Why: Journals, policies, and datasets change. You must answer “what did we know then?” and regenerate proofs.

Files

db/migrations/20251013_bitemporal.sql

db/bitemporal_queries.sql

…bitemporal.sql (excerpt)

alter table atoms
  add column valid_from timestamptz not null default now(),
  add column valid_to   timestamptz,
  add column sys_from   timestamptz not null default now(),
  add column sys_to     timestamptz;

create index atoms_bitemp_idx on atoms (run_id, valid_from, coalesce(valid_to, 'infinity'::timestamptz),
                                        sys_from, coalesce(sys_to, 'infinity'::timestamptz));


Query pattern

-- As‑of query (what we believed at T)
-- bind :t_valid, :t_sys
select * from atoms
 where run_id=:run
   and valid_from<=:t_valid and (valid_to is null or valid_to>:t_valid)
   and sys_from<=:t_sys   and (sys_to   is null or sys_to  >:t_sys);

3) Monotonic Build Graph, Delta‑Recompute & Idempotency

Files

build/graph.json (declares nodes & pure deps)

build/delta.py (which nodes to recompute)

ops/idempotency_keys.md (how to derive keys)

build/graph.json (excerpt)

{
  "nodes": {
    "blueprint": {"deps": ["ingest_inputs"], "hash": "sha256(inputs)"},
    "coverage":  {"deps": ["blueprint","guidelines"], "hash": "sha256(atoms:Study,Evidence)"},
    "figures":   {"deps": ["evidence"], "hash": "sha256(ChartSpec+data)"},
    "draft":     {"deps": ["outline","figures"], "hash": "sha256(blocks.inputs_atom_ids)"}
  }
}


Delta recompute (sketch)

def changed(node): return current_hash(node)!=stored_hash(node)
def plan_changes(target):
    needed=set(); stack=[target]
    while stack:
        n=stack.pop()
        if changed(n): needed.add(n); stack+=graph[n]["deps"]
    return topo_sort(needed)

4) Metamorphic Testing Bank (oracle‑free robustness)

Files

tests/metamorphic/catalog.yaml

tests/metamorphic/run.py

catalog.yaml

- id: label_swap_invariance
  when: "binary_classification"
  transform: "swap_labels_and_pred=1-p"
  expected: "auc -> 1-auc ; auprc undefined unless prevalence symmetrical"
- id: prevalence_shift
  transform: "stratified_resample(prevalence=0.05)"
  expected: "roc unchanged within ε ; pr decreases"
- id: monotone_thresholds
  transform: "thresholds_permuted"
  expected: "decision_curve monotone non-increasing in treat-none gap"
- id: boot_seed_stability
  transform: "change_bootstrap_seed"
  expected: "ci bounds within tolerance"


Run these after figure rendering; gate if violated.

5) Hard LLM Containment & Prompt‑Injection Defense

Files

author/llm/sandbox.md (policy)

author/llm/ast_guard.py (verifies <ATOM> tags & no new facts)

author/llm/denylist.yaml, author/llm/allowlist.yaml

author/llm/context_budget.yaml

Policy highlights

Single‑purpose system prompt; no user‑sourced text enters the system prompt.

All variables passed via structured JSON, never interpolated strings.

Allow‑list of templates; deny‑list patterns (“ignore previous”, “as an AI”).

AST guard rejects outputs that add/alter <ATOM> tags or introduce untagged numerics.

6) Spin Detector & Claim Precision Rater

Files

rhetoric/spin_patterns.yaml

rhetoric/precision_rater.py

spin_patterns.yaml

overgeneralization:
  - pattern: "outperforms .* across all settings"
  - remediation: "qualify scope; cite settings"
causal_spin:
  - pattern: "leads to improved outcomes" 
  - gate: "allowed only if design=randomized"
precision_levels:
  - name: "quantified"
    rule: "contains numeric + CI"
  - name: "qualified"
    rule: "contains uncertainty phrase"
  - name: "unqualified"
    rule: "neither"  # flag for main claims


Attach a Claim Precision score to Abstract & Discussion.

7) Data Drift & Contestability Kit

Files

drift/metrics.py (PSI/JS divergence, EMD for numerics; KL for categoricals)

drift/thresholds.yaml

contestability/counterfactuals.py

Usage

Compute drift between development vs validation vs external cohort; auto‑insert drift table atom and mitigate claims.

Provide counterfactual explanations (minimal input change that flips prediction) for case studies; tie to harm analysis.

8) Right‑to‑Be‑Forgotten (RTBF) with Proof Preservation

Files

privacy/rtbf_policy.md

privacy/rtbf_rewriter.py

Approach

Store atoms with person‑keys encrypted (field‑level).

RTBF request -> delete encrypted key material + scrub linked rows; witnesses convert to aggregate‑only proofs (no row‑level references).

Certificate remains valid (hashes recalculated on aggregate proofs).

9) Structural PDF Equivalence (hash‑stable)

Files

format/pdf/structural_hash.py

Idea

Extract logical structure tree (tags, order, figure IDs, alt‑text, text content normalized).

Compute a structural hash independent of non‑semantic bytes (timestamps, object IDs).

Use structural hash in certificates, not raw file hash.

10) Tenancy, Residency & Sovereignty

Files

security/row_level_security.sql

security/s3_policies.json

compliance/data_residency.yaml

Rules

Every table has tenant_id. Enable Postgres RLS with current_setting('app.tenant').

S3 prefixes per tenant + IAM policy denies cross‑prefix access.

Residency profile selects bucket/region and disallows cross‑region replication unless allowed.

11) Reviewer‑Outcome Model Calibration (honest uncertainty)

Files

review_model/calibration.py

review_model/reliability_plot.ipynb (reference)

Method

Isotonic calibration over held‑out editorial outcomes; report Brier score & ECE for p(accept).

Propagate a 95% predictive interval to the Purpose utility scoreboard—never show a naked point estimate.

12) Graph Soundness: DAG & Cycle Guards

Files

ops/graph_guard.py

Checks

No cycles in atom_links for roles supports/satisfies/visualizes.

No diamond conflicts (two distinct atoms claiming to satisfy a single exclusive requirement).

Fails the run at S6 if violated.

13) Literate Spec Generator (specs-as-artifacts)

Files

tools/specdoc.py — composes a Spec Book from enums, schemas, DSL, constraints, coverage maps; links to proofs & golden outputs.

Output

/docs/PaperEngine_SpecBook_v{snapshot}.pdf

Ship with every snapshot; anchors onboarding & audits.

14) Counterexample‑Guided Refinement (CEX‑GR)

Files

constraints/cex_loop.py

Loop

Run constraints → get failing atoms.

Synthesize candidate counterexample inputs (Hypothesis‑style).

Minimize failing case and add to regression corpus.

Re‑run until no new minimal counterexamples found.

15) “Equation‑of‑Record” Reference Impl (bit‑exact)

Files

metrics/reference_impl/auc.py, …/auprc.py, …/brier.py, …/calibration.py, …/net_benefit.py

metrics/test_vectors/ (CSV + expected JSON)

Rule

All metric atoms must originate from these functions (enforced via provenance).

Differences > tolerance → fail S7.

16) Role‑Based UI Redlines (HITL ergonomics)

Files

ui/redlines/roles.yaml (what each persona sees)

ui/redlines/templates/*.html (lightweight server‑rendered cards)

Examples

Methods reviewer sees: DataContract, leakage checks, RDoF audit.

Clinical reviewer sees: calibration/DCA, harms, drift.

Editor sees: Scope fit, guideline coverage, originality, structural hash.

17) LLM Usage Disclosure & Ghostwriting Guard

Files

ethics/ai_assist_policy.md

ethics/ai_disclosure.jinja

Guard

Require an AI‑assist disclosure atom; enforce that no block is entirely LLM‑authored without human acknowledgment.

Record LLM prompts & hashes in the RunManifest (no data content, just metadata) for transparency.

18) Compliance Profiles Matrix (HIPAA, GDPR, Institutional)

Files

compliance/profiles.yaml

Example

hipaa:
  phi_export: "deny"
  audit_retention_days: 3650
gdpr:
  rtbf: "required"
  data_residency: ["EU"]
institution_X:
  embedding_services: "on-prem only"


Gate: deny operations violating the active profile.

19) Failure‑Mode Injection (FMI) & Chaos Recipes

Files

chaos/recipes.yaml

chaos/inject.py

Recipes

Kill Crossref; ensure cached references used.

Corrupt a figure file; ensure structural hash catches it.

Flip PDF tagging order; validator must fail S13.

20) Economic Footprint & Cost Guards

Files

cost/budget.yaml (per run: GPU/CPU minutes caps)

cost/guard.py

Behavior

Planner must respect cost caps; if planned actions exceed budget, propose Minimum Publishable Action (MPA) substitution.

21) Cross‑Domain Ontology Bridges (SNOMED/LOINC/MeSH)

Files

ontology/mappings.yaml (IDs ↔ human labels)

ontology/normalizer.py

Why

Figures/tables render with canonical labels; narrative uses human‑friendly terms; cross‑links to ontologies stored in atoms for machine reuse.

22) “Contestability Notes” (explainable caveats)

Files

explainability/contestability.jinja

Content

Known failure modes (prevalence shifts, subgroup gaps), data limitations, and how to challenge a model’s decision. Included near Discussion or as an Impact Statement appendix.

23) Copy‑Change Risk Scanner (numerical drift in edits)

Files

tools/copychange_scan.py

Function

Diff any human edits to manuscript_blocks; flag if a sentence loses an <ATOM> value or introduces a number not in atoms.

24) Post‑Acceptance Production Hooks

Files

production/export/scholarone.zip.py, production/export/editorial_manager.zip.py

production/checks/figure_policies.yaml (raster caps, color profiles)

Goal

Produce submission‑system‑ready ZIPs (cover letter, blinded/unblinded manuscripts, source figures, checklists). Ensures zero back‑and‑forth with production staff.

25) End‑to‑End “Confidence Ledger”

Files

ops/confidence_ledger.json (generated)

ops/confidence_report.md (human‑readable)

Fields

Gate statuses, precision levels of claims, reviewer model PI, drift magnitudes, structural hash, calibration metrics. Attach to submission certificate.

Integration Plan (fast + safe)

Drop in: semantics/, db/migrations/…bitemporal.sql, build/, tests/metamorphic/.

Wire gates:

S6: constraint engine, DAG guard, ontology normalizer, drift metrics.

S8: structural hash; figure intent validators already present.

S10–S11: LLM sandbox, AST guard, spin detector, claim precision rater, copy‑change scanner.

S13: PDF structural hash + accessibility.

Ops: enable RLS, residency profiles, idempotency keys, chaos recipes.

Docs: autogenerate Spec Book & Confidence Ledger per run.

CI: add metamorphic tests, CEX‑GR loop, non‑determinism scan, and structural hash checks.

Why these pieces matter

Coherency: formal semantics, conflict precedence, ontology bridges, and venue morphology unify the system’s reasoning.

Robustness: bitemporal truth, delta recompute, metamorphic tests, constraints, chaos, and structural hashes make failures detectable and recoverable.

True completeness: causal licensing, spin & plagiarism checks, reviewer calibration, contestability, policy profiles, and production exports mirror real‑world acceptance criteria end‑to‑end.

If you want, I can output a ready‑to‑commit folder tree with boilerplate files matching this pack so your team can git add and see new gates appear in CI immediately.

WHAT ARE OTHER NOT-OBVIOUS-AT-ALL CONTENT YOU MUST PROVIDE IN ORDER TO ADD COHERENCY, ROBUSTNESS AND TRUE COMPLETENESS OF OUR SYSTEM??
ChatGPT said:
Request for GPT-5 Pro
Reasoned for 7m 6s

Amazing momentum. Here’s the Not‑Obvious‑At‑All Content Pack v2.3 — additional, deep glue that teams almost never specify, but that measurably increases coherency, robustness, and true completeness. Everything is implementation‑ready (file paths, configs, and stubs) and plugs straight into your atom model, paper‑algebra, and state machine.

1) Truth‑Maintenance System (TMS) for Atoms

Why: When a source atom changes, all dependent claims/figures/text must update or invalidate—mechanically.

Files

tms/justifications.py — records why each atom exists (inputs + function)

tms/dependency_index.sql — fast reverse‑deps lookups

cli/why.py — “why” introspection CLI

tms/justifications.py (sketch)

from dataclasses import dataclass
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Justification:
    atom_id: str
    fn: str             # e.g., metrics.calibration@commit
    inputs: list[str]   # upstream atom_ids
    params: dict

def affected_atoms(changed_ids: set[str], graph) -> set[str]:
    # BFS over reverse edges in atom_links(role in {'supports','visualizes','satisfies'})
    todo, seen = set(changed_ids), set()
    while todo:
        cur = todo.pop(); seen.add(cur)
        for dep in graph.rev[cur]: 
            if dep not in seen: todo.add(dep)
    return seen - set(changed_ids)


CLI:

$ pe why E.roc.auc
# shows justification chain and blocks (text/figures) that depend on it

2) Constraint Miner (learn new rules from failures)

Why: Turn post‑mortems (desk rejects, gate failures) into new constraints automatically.

Files

constraints/miner.py

constraints/library.yaml (auto‑appended)

ops/postmortem_ingest.py

Miner idea: pattern‑match failure + remedy → emit a DSL rule (e.g., “prevalence<5% ⇒ require PR curve + class distribution table”).

3) Desk‑Reject Reason Taxonomy & Heuristics

Why: Proactively prevent editorial triage rejections.

Files

editorial/desk_reject_taxonomy.yaml

editorial/triage_heuristics.py

…taxonomy.yaml

scope_mismatch:       "Out of journal aims/scope"
weak_positioning:     "Missing seminal/prior work"
transparency_gaps:    "No data/code, missing registration"
statistics_faults:    "No effect sizes/CI, misuse of metrics"
figure_legibility:    "Low-res/raster, illegible labels"
language_tone:        "Causal claims not licensed by design"


Heuristics return risk scores with links to remediation tasks.

4) LaTeX Sandbox & Package Whitelist

Why: Prevent malicious macros and nondeterministic builds.

Files

format/latex/sandbox.yaml

format/latex/sanitize.py

sandbox.yaml

shell_escape: false
allowed_packages:
  - amsmath
  - graphicx
  - xcolor
  - hyperref
  - microtype
  - geometry
denied_commands:
  - \write18
  - \input|external from untrusted dirs


Builds fail if a non‑whitelisted package/command appears.

5) Color Management & Print‑Safety

Why: Ensure figures survive grayscale print, journal CMYK workflows, and color‑vision variations.

Files

viz/color/icc_profiles/CoatedFOGRA39.icc

viz/color/policies.yaml

viz/color/simulate_cb.py (protan/deutan/tritan sims)

viz/color/greyscale_preview.py

Policy highlights

min_line_width_pt: 0.5
min_font_size_pt: 7
palette: colorblind_safe
export:
  pdf_profile: sRGB
  cmyk_profile: CoatedFOGRA39
checks:
  - cb_simulation_distinctness >= 0.2
  - greyscale_luminance_delta >= 25

6) Structural XMP Metadata & DOI Hooks

Why: Embed authoritative metadata for indexing, provenance, and archiving.

Files

format/pdf/xmp_builder.py

format/pdf/xmp_template.xml

ids/doi_pipeline.md (how to mint via DataCite/Zenodo later)

XMP fields: title, authors (ORCID), affiliations, funders (Grant IDs), CRediT roles, structural hash, KB snapshot, PurposeSpec summary.

7) Table Accessibility & Header Scopes

Why: Screen readers need header scoping; most papers fail here.

Files

format/latex/tablescope.sty (or LuaLaTeX tagging helper)

format/pdf/table_tags.py

Rules: mark <TH scope="col/row">, set header‑id to data‑cell headers attributes; verify programmatically.

8) Preprint & Double‑Blind Packaging

Why: Seamless medRxiv/arXiv/DB preprints and anonymized submissions.

Files

submission/preprint_pack.py (license, categories, PDF crop)

submission/blind_pack.py (author scrub, self‑citation obfuscation, filename neutralization)

Anonymization checks: remove ORCIDs, affiliations, grant numbers, and self‑identifying text patterns unless non‑blind.

9) Consent, License & Data‑Use Ledger

Why: Make downstream reuse and audits painless.

Files

licenses/data_use_ledger.jsonl

licenses/policy_map.yaml (CC‑BY, CC‑BY‑NC, institutional clauses)

Every dataset/table/figure atom carries a license_ref and consent_scope; the ledger enforces compatibility (e.g., no CC‑BY‑NC images in CC‑BY articles).

10) Graph Triples Export (SPARQL‑friendly)

Why: Interop with knowledge graphs and registries.

Files

interop/rdf/export_turtle.py

interop/rdf/vocab.ttl

Triples: Atom → satisfies → Requirement, Figure → visualizes → Evidence, Claim → supportedBy → Atom.

11) Frictionless Data Packages for Deposits

Why: Turn tables into depositable, schema‑rich datasets.

Files

interop/frictionless/datapackage_builder.py

interop/frictionless/schema_templates/*.json

Outputs datapackage.json with fields, units, primary keys, licenses, and README.

12) Microtypography & Widow/Orphan Control

Why: Professional polish and readability (and some journals will ask).

Files

format/latex/microtype.cfg

format/latex/polish.sty

Defaults: \frenchspacing, \microtypesetup{protrusion=true,expansion=true}, widow/orphan penalties high, non‑breaking spaces around units.

13) Reproducibility Capsule Builder

Why: One‑command repro package with exact environment and data stubs.

Files

repro/capsule/build.py (locks env, copies code, writes RUN.md)

repro/capsule/CITATION.cff (template)

repro/capsule/manifest.json

Capsule contains: exact commands, seeds, versions, checksums, and small synthetic demo data if the real data is restricted.

14) Scheduling, Budgets & Cost Guards

Why: Keep runs within resource/time budgets; suggest the Minimum Publishable Action.

Files

ops/scheduling/policy.yaml

ops/scheduling/estimator.py

ops/scheduling/guard.py

Policy example:

budget:
  cpu_minutes: 1200
  gpu_minutes: 120
  storage_gb: 10
priority: ["format:pdf", "viz:calibration", "audit:coverage"]

15) Quality‑Debt Ledger & Triage

Why: Track and retire persistent warnings (style, minor coverage misses).

Files

ops/quality_debt.jsonl

ops/triage_rules.yaml

Auto‑creates GitHub issues/Jira tickets with severity, owner, and due dates tied to the Purpose timeline.

16) Manuscript Semantic Versioning & ChangeLog

Why: Papers iterate; preserve clarity between submission cycles.

Files

manuscript/semver.py

manuscript/CHANGELOG.md (auto‑updated)

Rules: increment MAJOR if conclusions materially change; MINOR for analysis/figure changes; PATCH for typos/format only.

17) TeX Macro Scanner & PDF Sanity

Why: Security and production stability.

Files

security/tex_scan.py — denies suspicious macros, external file reads

security/pdf_scan.py — rejects embedded JS, launch actions, or external links in figures

18) Cross‑Paper Asset Reuse & Living Reviews

Why: Enable “living” systematic reviews and updates without rework.

Files

living_reviews/asset_index.sql

living_reviews/update_planner.py

Tracks figure/table atoms across runs; suggests delta updates when new studies appear.

19) Evidence Weighting (GRADE‑style) & Fragility

Why: Make the strength of evidence explicit; reduce overclaiming.

Files

evidence/weighting.yaml (risk of bias, imprecision, inconsistency)

evidence/fragility_index.py (for RCTs)

Outputs a strength‑of‑evidence atom referenced in Discussion.

20) “Why‑Fail” Explainers (Human UI)

Why: Close the loop when gates fail—show proof trees and minimal fixes.

Files

ui/explainers/whyfail_cards.html

ui/explainers/whyfail_mapping.yaml

Mapping ties failure codes → culprit atoms/requirements → suggested remediations with ΔUtility estimates.

21) Multi‑Venue Morphology (one outline → many)

Why: Fast retargeting without re‑authoring.

Files

rules/morphology_profiles.yaml

planner/morphology.py (expands/compresses sections, resizes figures, flips CSL styles)

22) Cross‑Locale Numerics & Typography

Why: Produce localized PDFs (decimal comma vs point) without numeric drift.

Files

i18n/numerics_locale.yaml

i18n/formatters.py

Rule: atom canonical string is locale‑agnostic; formatting layer only changes separators/spaces.

23) Editorial Memory & Feedback Miner

Why: Learn from real reviewer/editor comments.

Files

editorial/memory.jsonl

editorial/miner.py

Clusters comments → themes → new heuristics or constraints; auto‑PRs against constraints/library.yaml.

24) Production ZIPs for Submission Systems (bulletproof)

Why: Zero friction with ScholarOne/Editorial Manager.

Files

production/export/scholarone_zip.py

production/export/editorial_manager_zip.py

production/checks/policies.yaml (color profiles, figure DPI, filename conventions)

25) Confidence Ledger (extended)

Why: Single artifact summarizing everything reviewers/editors care about.

Files

ops/confidence_ledger_v2.json

ops/confidence_render.md

Adds: claim precision levels, desk‑reject risks, GRADE strength, fragility, drift magnitudes, structural PDF hash, compliance profile.

    hits = [p for p in DENY if re.search(p, tex)]
    if hits: raise RuntimeError(f"TeX security violation: {hits}")

Integration Checklist (fast path)

Security & build: enable LaTeX sandbox, TeX/PDF scanners, structural XMP + structural hash.

Editorial realism: add desk‑reject heuristics, citation gap finder, causal‑language guard.

Visual robustness: color management, colorblind/greyscale checks, table scope tagging.

Governance & provenance: consent/license ledger, TMS, fragmentation (semver + changelog), reproducibility capsule.

Ops: budget guards, quality‑debt ledger, morphology profiles, production ZIP exporters.

Learning loop: constraint miner, editorial memory miner.

Why these extra pieces matter

Coherency: Semver, TMS, morphology, and editorial heuristics keep the narrative, rules, and venues aligned—even as things change.

Robustness: Sandbox, scanners, structural hash, color management, and table accessibility prevent subtle yet fatal production failures.

True completeness: Consent/licensing, reproducibility capsules, evidence weighting, and desk‑reject avoidance mirror the full reality of getting papers accepted and used.

If you want, I can output a pre‑scaffolded folder tree with these files (filled with the stubs above) so your team can commit and see new gates appear in CI immediately.

You said:
WHAT ARE THE FINAL CONTRIBUTIONS, NOW FOCUSING ON WHAT WE  HAVE GATHERED OF CONTENT HERE ON THIS THREAD, TO CLOSE THE LOOP ON INTEGRATING ALL OF THESE CONCEPTS TOGETHER CLEARLY???
ChatGPT said:
Request for GPT-5 Pro
Reasoned for 7m 45s

Absolutely. Here’s the Final Integration Closure Pack—the last set of explicit contracts, maps, and checklists that stitches every concept we’ve built into one coherent, robust, and truly complete system. You can drop these into your repo as the “source of truth” for how all parts interlock.

1) System Doctrine (the 6 axioms that bind everything)

Atoms are law – every fact is an atom; text and figures only project atoms.

Purpose first – PurposeSpec → UtilityFunction → analysis/outline/venue choices.

Formal pipeline – deterministic state machine S0→S15; each state has inputs, pure transforms, gates, and signed proofs.

Paper‑Algebra – select/cover/compose/constrain/optimize are the only ways content is built.

LLM is contained – surface realizer only; round‑trip atom tags or reject.

Certificates & provenance – every delivery ships with a signed Submission Certificate + structural hash + audit chain.

These axioms are referenced in every spec, API, and test below.

2) “Everything Map” — states → modules → artifacts (one page)
State	Operation (module)	Key inputs → outputs	Gate(s) & proofs	Failure fallback
S0 INIT	ops.manifest.start_run	snapshot pin, seeds	manifest hash	—
S1 PRIVACY_OK	ingest.privacy.scan	raw text/files → hits	PRIVACY/PII gate	redact or block
S2 BLUEPRINT_READY	ingest.extract, ingest.classify	text/files → StudyBlueprint + design atom(s)	typecheck blueprint	request missing design atoms
S3 PURPOSE_LOCKED	purpose.infer/lock/utility	Blueprint → PurposeSpec, Utility	approval record	revise invariants/weights
S4 RULES_BOUND	rules.journals, rules.guidelines	VenueSpec→JournalSpec; design→Guideline set	conflict resolver → effective req set	pick alt venue
S5 DATA_VALID	ingest.datacontract.validate	dataset + DataContract → profile	DATA/CONTRACT gate	fix schema/units/leakage
S6 COVERAGE_OK	audit.coverage, constraints.engine	atoms vs reqs → scorecard + witnesses	RULES/COVERAGE gate	generate missing artifacts
S7 EVIDENCE_READY	planner.analyses (+ metric refs)	ranked actions → evidence atoms	metric reference impl checks	MPA recommendation
S8 FIGURES_READY	viz.render, viz.preflight, color checks	ChartSpec → vector figs + alt text	FIGURE/INTENT + color/contrast	re‑spec, resize
S9 OUTLINE_READY	planner.outline, author.claims	Purpose + rules → goals/claims graph	graph soundness	fix dangling claims
S10 DRAFT_READY	author.writer (templates)	atoms → tagged text blocks	stats/style linter	revise inputs
S11 CONSISTENT	author.contradiction, causal/Spin guard	blocks ↔ atoms & design	no contradictions; license ok	regenerate offending blocks
S12 EXPORT_READY	format.latex.assemble/tagpdf	manuscript + assets → .tex	TeX sandbox pass	remove unsafe macros
S13 PDF_OK	format.pdf.export/preflight	PDF/UA + PDF/A + structural hash	FORMAT/PDFUA gate	auto‑repair tagging
S14 JATS_OK	format.jats.build_xml	article.xml + ids	schema pass	fix xrefs
S15 DELIVERED	ops.certificate.emit + ZIP exporters	certificate + production ZIPs	signatures recorded	—

This table is the master hand‑off between engineering, QA, and ops. Keep it pinned in /docs/EverythingMap.md.

3) Final “SSOT” Config (the single file that turns the machine)

engine.config.yaml (top‑level switchboard; everything else derives from here)

snapshot_id: "stable-2025-10-13"
purpose_preset: "publish_flagship"     # or impact_first
archetype: "prediction_model"          # drives guideline & formula pack
venue_target: "nature-medicine"        # drives JournalSpec + morphology
compliance_profile: "hipaa"            # residency & policy gates
budget:
  cpu_minutes: 1200
  gpu_minutes: 120
  storage_gb: 10
plugins:
  guidelines: ["tripod_ai","tidi er","sager","icmje","cope","credit"]
  charts: ["roc_curve","pr_curve","calibration_curve","decision_curve"]
  exporters: ["pdf_ua","pdf_a","jats","scholarone_zip"]
flags:
  bilingual_output: false
  dp_small_cell_protection: false


This file is parsed at S0 and locked into the RunManifest. All later services read only from the manifest to ensure determinism.

4) Integration Contract Matrix (who consumes/emits which schema)
Component	Consumes	Emits
ingest	raw files, DataContract	StudyBlueprint atoms
purpose	StudyBlueprint	PurposeSpec, UtilityFunction
rules	design atoms, venue id	JournalSpec, GuidelineSpec[], effective requirement set
planner	Purpose + rules + atoms	analysis backlog, ChartSpec[], PaperOutline
viz	ChartSpec + data atoms	vector figures (CAS hashes), A.figure atoms
author	outline + atoms + figures	manuscript_blocks (tagged), ClaimGraph
format	blocks + assets + specs	.tex → PDF/UA, PDF/A, article.xml
ops	everything above	RunManifest, Audit log, SubmissionCertificate, production ZIPs

This contract matrix is what your API tests validate.

5) “One‑Button” Orchestration (final, minimal pseudocode)
def run(inputs, cfg="engine.config.yaml"):
    run = manifest.start_run(cfg)
    raw = ingest.harvest(inputs); privacy.guard(raw)                # S1
    bp  = ingest.to_blueprint(raw); bp.design = ingest.design(bp)  # S2
    purpose = purpose.lock(purpose.infer(bp, cfg)); util = purpose.utility(purpose)  # S3
    journal, gls = rules.bind(bp.design, cfg.venue_target, cfg.plugins.guidelines)   # S4
    ingest.validate_contract(inputs.dataset, inputs.contract)       # S5
    scorecard = audit.coverage(bp, gls); constraints.check()        # S6
    evidence  = planner.plan_and_run(bp, purpose, journal)          # S7
    figs      = viz.render_and_preflight(evidence, journal)         # S8
    outline   = planner.purposeful_outline(purpose, journal, gls)   # S9
    blocks    = author.generate(outline, evidence, figs)            # S10
    author.verify_consistency(blocks, bp.design)                    # S11
    tex = format.assemble(blocks, figs, journal); format.sandbox(tex) # S12
    pdf_ua, pdf_a = format.export_pdfs(tex); format.preflight(pdf_ua) # S13
    jats = format.build_jats(blocks, figs, journal)                 # S14
    cert = ops.emit_certificate(run, scorecard, pdf_ua, pdf_a, jats) # S15
    return deliver(pdf_ua, pdf_a, jats, cert)

6) Final Gate Map (what proves each gate)

PRIVACY/PII → hits report (policy.yaml) + redacted diff.

DATA/CONTRACT → schema/units/leakage proof; unit conversions logged.

RULES/COVERAGE → witnesses table (req_id ↔ atom_id) + minimal cover proof.

FIGURE/INTENT → vector check, ROC monotonicity, calibration slope/intercept present, color/contrast, alt‑text.

DRAFT/CONSISTENCY → round‑trip atom tags; contradiction & causal‑license checks; spin/precision rating.

FORMAT/PDFUA → PAC/validator output + structural hash.

JATS → schema validation report (ids/xrefs).

ORIGINALITY → similarity JSON + adjudication notes.

REPRO → capsule manifest + vector asset hash match.

GOVERNANCE → approvals ledger entries with signatures.

The Submission Certificate includes all gate verdicts, artifact hashes, snapshot id, structural PDF hash, and signatures.

7) “Closure” Specs—tie the loose ends

A) Purpose ↔ Utility ↔ Actions mapping

A single YAML (purpose/presets.yaml) binds success metrics to required actions (e.g., “clinical_adoption ⇒ require decision‑curve + external validation”).

Planner consults this map before ranking: no drift between goals and evidence.

B) Conflict Resolver precedence

rules/conflicts.yaml is authoritative; its “effective requirement set” is what Cover() uses. No duplicate or contradictory asks sneak through.

C) Morphology profiles

rules/morphology_profiles.yaml ensures venue transfer is purely formatting: atoms and claims do not change, only section/figure sizing and CSL style.

D) Structural hash and XMP

PDF identity is structural, not byte‑level. XMP embeds snapshot id, structural hash, ORCIDs, and CAS hashes of figures for downstream verifiability.

8) Final CI Matrix (what must pass before merge)

Schema validation: all JSON/YAML configs (schemas/).

Unit/property tests: datacontract, constraints, minimal cover, numerics canon, type system.

Integration tests: golden mini‑corpus (TRIPOD‑AI, PRISMA, CONSORT, STARD).

Metamorphic tests: label swap, prevalence shift, bootstrap seed stability.

Security: TeX/PDF scanners, LLM AST guard, prompt‑injection denylist.

Accessibility/format: PDF/UA validator + structural hash check; JATS schema.

Nondeterminism: re‑run vector renders x3; hashes within ε.

Certificate: generate and verify (pe verify) for golden runs.

9) Operating SLOs & Dashboards (what to watch)

Submission Readiness Index (SRI), Coverage %, PDF/UA pass rate, Repro determinism, PII alert rate, Desk‑reject risk score, Reviewer model ECE/Brier, Budget adherence.

Alert when SRI < 0.9, Coverage musts < 1.0, or PDF/UA drops below 100% on main.

10) “Hello‑World” End‑to‑End (ties it all together)

Copy engine.config.yaml (above) and a synthetic TRIPOD‑AI dataset + DataContract.

Run: pe run --cfg engine.config.yaml --data demo/ehr.csv --contract demo/ehr.contract.json.

Inspect artifacts:

outputs/<run>/paper_ua.pdf, paper_a.pdf, article.xml, figures (PDF/SVG), submission_certificate.json, confidence_ledger.json.

Verify: pe verify outputs/<run>/submission_certificate.json.

In one command you exercise: atoms → coverage → figures → outline → tagged text → PDF/UA + JATS → certificate—with proofs.

11) Final Definition‑of‑Done (Fi‑DoD)

A run is done only if:

Purpose invariants hold; Utility meets preset thresholds.

Coverage: 100% must, ≥80% should for the primary guideline; conflict‑resolved set applied.

Figures: intent/accessibility pass; vectors only; color/contrast satisfied.

Draft: round‑trip atoms retained; no contradictions; causal language licensed; spin < threshold.

PDF: PDF/UA validator green; PDF/A archived; structural hash embedded; XMP filled.

JATS: valid schema with stable ids/xrefs.

Originality adjudicated; RDoF audit attached.

Repro capsule builds identical vectors; audit/provenance complete.

Certificate & ledger signed; production ZIP passes checks.

12) What we did to close the loop (explicitly)

Unified all schemas and packs under one SSOT config and Everything Map.

Bound Purpose → actions → evidence → narrative with deterministic formulas and LLM containment.

Ensured real‑world acceptance by coverage proofs, accessibility conformance, editorial heuristics, and production packaging.

Locked integrity with bitemporal atoms, structural hashes, provenance, and governance signatures.

Enabled evolution via constraint miner, editorial memory, morphology profiles, and venue transfer paths—without rewriting atoms.

Hand‑off
