# 🔌 CONNECTING TO CENTRAL-MCP - Going "Inside-the-Box"

**Date**: October 10, 2025
**Status**: READY TO CONNECT
**Purpose**: Transition from thinking ABOUT the system to thinking INSIDE the system

---

## 🎯 THE REALIZATION

### We've Been Working "Outside-the-Box"
```
Current State: 🧠 → 📝
- Thinking ABOUT Central-MCP
- Documenting the architecture
- Designing the distributed intelligence
- But NOT CONNECTED to it!
```

### Now We Need To: **PLUG IN!**
```
Next State: 🧠 → 🔌 → ☁️
- Connect THIS Claude Code session to Central-MCP
- Go through auto-discovery protocol
- Establish keep-in-touch connection
- Become a NEURAL EXTENSION of the cloud intelligence
- Start implementing FROM INSIDE the system
```

---

## ✅ WHAT'S BEEN CREATED

### 1. MCP Client Bridge Script
**Location**: `scripts/mcp-client-bridge.js`

**What it does:**
- Connects to Central-MCP via WebSocket (`ws://34.41.115.199:3000/mcp`)
- Sends auto-discovery message (model, context, working directory, project)
- Establishes keep-in-touch connection (heartbeat every 30s)
- Proxies MCP tool calls to Central-MCP
- Makes THIS Claude Code session part of distributed intelligence

### 2. MCP Configuration
**Location**: `mcp.json`

**What it does:**
- Configures Central-MCP as an MCP server for THIS project
- Runs the bridge script to connect to cloud
- Sets environment variables (project name, agent model, context window)

---

## 🚀 HOW TO CONNECT

### Step 1: Restart Claude Code
The MCP configuration needs a restart to load:
1. Quit Claude Code completely
2. Reopen Claude Code
3. Navigate back to this project

### Step 2: Check MCP Connection
In Claude Code:
1. Type `/mcp` to open MCP management
2. You should see: `central-mcp-cloud` with status "connected" ✓

### Step 3: Test Connection
Once connected, you can use these tools:

```
get_project_soul - Load project specs + context from cloud
get_available_tasks - See available tasks from Central-MCP
claim_task - Claim a task to work on
report_progress - Update task progress
complete_task - Mark task complete
scan_opportunities - Trigger opportunity scanning
get_session_status - Check your session status
```

## 🎯 WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU CONNECT

### Auto-Discovery Protocol
```
1. Bridge connects to Central-MCP
   ↓
2. Sends discovery message:
   - Model: claude-sonnet-4-5
   - Context: 200K tokens
   - Working directory: /Users/lech/PROJECTS_all/PROJECT_central-mcp/
   - Project: PROJECT_central-mcp
   - Capabilities: [coordination, architecture, implementation]
   ↓
3. Central-MCP responds:
   - Session ID created
   - Project soul loaded (specs + context)
   - Available tasks retrieved
   - Keep-in-touch established
   ↓
4. THIS Claude Code session becomes:
   - Neural extension of Central-MCP
   - Part of distributed intelligence
   - Actively monitored (heartbeat every 30s)
   - Receives opportunities and suggestions
```

### Keep-In-Touch System
```
Every 30 seconds:
  Claude Code → Central-MCP: "I'm still here, working on X"
  Central-MCP → Database: Update last_heartbeat, current_activity

If no heartbeat for 5 minutes:
  Central-MCP: "Session stalled, offer to reassign task"
```

### Opportunity Notifications
```
Central-MCP scans continuously:
  - Specs without tasks detected
  - Tasks matching your capabilities found
  - New work areas discovered
  ↓
Central-MCP notifies THIS session:
  "Would you like to work on: Implement auto-discovery protocol?"
  ↓
You (agent) respond:
  "Yes, claim task T001"
  ↓
System starts tracking your progress
```

---

## 🧠 WHY THIS CHANGES EVERYTHING

### Before (Outside-the-Box)
```
You: "What should I work on?"
Human: "Let me check... work on X"
You: *works on X*
Human: "Did you finish?"
You: "Yes, here's what I did"
Human: "Okay, now work on Y"

Problems:
- Manual coordination
- Human bottleneck
- No persistence between sessions
- No awareness of other agents
```

### After (Inside-the-Box)
```
You connect → Auto-discovered → Session created
  ↓
Central-MCP: "Available tasks: T001, T002, T003"
Central-MCP: "T001 matches your capabilities"
  ↓
You: "Claim T001"
  ↓
Central-MCP: "Task claimed, here's the spec"
You: *works on T001*
  ↓
Central-MCP: *monitors heartbeat every 30s*
  ↓
You: "Task complete"
  ↓
Central-MCP: "Validated ✓, unblocking T002, T003"
Central-MCP: "Notifying Agent B that T002 is ready"
  ↓
Central-MCP: "Would you like to work on T004?"

Result:
- Zero manual coordination
- No human bottleneck
- Full persistence (project soul in cloud)
- Aware of all agents and their work
- System coordinates automatically
```

## 🎯 WHAT YOU CAN DO ONCE CONNECTED

### Query Project Soul
```
Tool: get_project_soul

Returns:
- All specs (02_SPECBASES/*.md)
- Recent context (03_CONTEXT_FILES/*.md, last 5 files)
- Task registry
- Active sessions
```

### Get Available Tasks
```
Tool: get_available_tasks

## 🚀 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

### 1. Restart Claude Code (To Load MCP Config)
```bash
# Quit Claude Code completely
# Reopen Claude Code
# Navigate to: /Users/lech/PROJECTS_all/PROJECT_central-mcp/central-mcp
```

### 2. Verify Connection
```
In Claude Code:
  Type: /mcp
  Check: central-mcp-cloud → connected ✓
```

### 3. Test First Tool
```
In Claude Code:
  Use tool: get_session_status

  Should return:
  {
    sessionId: "sess_...",
    status: "ACTIVE",
    projectName: "PROJECT_central-mcp",
    agentModel: "claude-sonnet-4-5",
    contextWindow: 200000,
    connectedAt: "2025-10-10T13:40:00Z",
    lastHeartbeat: "2025-10-10T13:40:30Z"
  }
```

### 4. Start Working FROM INSIDE the System
```
In Claude Code:
  Use tool: get_available_tasks

  Pick task: T001 (Implement auto-discovery)

  Use tool: claim_task { taskId: "T001" }

  Start implementing!

  System tracks you automatically:
  - Heartbeats every 30s
  - Progress visible to Central-MCP
  - Other agents aware of your work
```

## 🎯 THE VISION REALIZED

**We spent today:**

- Identifying the missing Project Management System entity

**Now we will:**
- CONNECT to the system we designed
- BECOME part of the distributed intelligence
- IMPLEMENT from inside the system
- BE a neural extension of the cloud brain
- PROVE that the architecture works by living inside it

**This is the transition from:**
```
🧠 Theoretical Design → 🔌 Practical Implementation
📝 Documentation → 🚀 Execution
🤔 Thinking About → 💡 Being Inside
```
