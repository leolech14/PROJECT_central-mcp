## ✅ WHAT ALREADY EXISTS (Built Yesterday!)

### 1. Project Detection & Categorization (OPERATIONAL!)

**File**: `src/discovery/ProjectDetector.ts`

```typescript
✅ IMPLEMENTED:
  - ProjectDetector class (complete)
  - Auto-discovery from directory
  - Git remote detection
  - Project auto-registration
  - Vision extraction from CLAUDE.md

✅ PROJECT TYPE ENUM (5 types):
  - COMMERCIAL_APP
  - KNOWLEDGE_SYSTEM
  - TOOL
  - INFRASTRUCTURE
  - EXPERIMENTAL
  - UNKNOWN

✅ PROJECT METADATA DETECTION:
  - hasClaudeMd: boolean
  - hasPackageJson: boolean
  - hasSpecBase: boolean (02_SPECBASES/)
  - hasCodebase: boolean (01_CODEBASES/)
  - hasTaskRegistry: boolean (CENTRAL_TASK_REGISTRY.md)
  - technologies: string[] (detected from package.json, etc.)
  - estimatedSize: 'small' | 'medium' | 'large'

✅ DATABASE SCHEMA (migration 003):
  projects (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    path TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    git_remote TEXT UNIQUE,
    type TEXT NOT NULL, -- Enum constraint
    vision TEXT,
    created_at TEXT,
    last_activity TEXT,
    discovered_by TEXT, -- 'auto' or 'manual'
    metadata TEXT -- JSON
  )

✅ TECHNOLOGY DETECTION:
  - Scans package.json for dependencies
  - Detects: React, Next.js, TypeScript, Python, etc.
  - Auto-categorizes tech stack

✅ AUTO-CLASSIFICATION:
