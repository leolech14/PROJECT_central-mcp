## 🚦 Deployment Pipeline Example

```yaml
# Example CI/CD Pipeline Flow
1. Code Push → Repository
2. Automated Tests → Unit/Integration/E2E
3. Build Artifacts → Docker images/Static assets
4. Security Scan → Vulnerability assessment
5. Deploy to Staging → Manual approval required
6. Smoke Tests → Validation in staging
7. Deploy to Production → Blue-green deployment
8. Health Checks → Post-deployment validation
9. Monitoring → Ongoing performance tracking
```
