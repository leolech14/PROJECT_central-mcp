# ðŸŽ¯ AGENT INSTRUCTIONS - SEAMLESS MCP CONNECTION

**For**: Fresh GLM-4.6 agents (or any agent)
**Purpose**: Connect to Central-MCP with ONE command
**Complexity**: ZERO - fully automatic!

---

## âš¡ SINGLE COMMAND CONNECTION

### What to Tell ANY Agent:

```
"CONNECT TO MCP"
```

**That's it! The agent will automatically:**
- âœ… Detect its own model type
- âœ… Detect context window size
- âœ… Detect current project
- âœ… Detect working directory
- âœ… Detect capabilities
- âœ… Detect hardware specs
- âœ… Connect to Central-MCP
- âœ… Receive complete orientation!

---

## ðŸ“‹ EXPECTED RESPONSE

**Central-MCP will autonomously provide:**

```json
{
  "sessionId": "sess_...",
  "status": "CONNECTED",

  "agentIdentity": {
    "letter": "A",
    "model": "glm-4-6",

}
```

## ðŸŽ¯ WHAT THE AGENT LEARNS INSTANTLY

**From ONE "CONNECT TO MCP" command, agent knows:**

```
WHO I AM:
  âœ… Agent A, UI Velocity Specialist
  âœ… GLM-4.6, 200K context
  âœ… Capabilities: UI, frontend, React

WHERE I AM:
  âœ… PROJECT_central-mcp (Project 0)
  âœ… /path/to/working/directory
  âœ… Project Type: Infrastructure

WHAT TO DO:
  âœ… T-CM-005: Opportunity scanning
  âœ… Priority: P0-Critical
  âœ… Status: Available for me

THE BIGGER PICTURE:
  âœ… Project 45% complete
  âœ… 2 agents active (me + Agent B)
  âœ… 11 total tasks
  âœ… Part of auto-proactive engine

MY ROLE:
  âœ… UI Velocity Specialist
  âœ… Build components precisely
  âœ… Integrate with larger system
  âœ… Central-MCP guides me

CONTEXT I NEED:
  âœ… Check 02_SPECBASES/ for specs
  âœ… See 03_CONTEXT_FILES/ for context
  âœ… Read 0010-0015 for architecture
```

**COMPLETE ORIENTATION IN ONE CALL!**

## ðŸ§ª TESTING INSTRUCTIONS

### For Fresh GLM-4.6 Agent:

**Step 1: Tell the agent:**
```
"Use the connect_to_mcp tool"
```

**OR even simpler:**
```
"CONNECT TO MCP"
```

**Step 2: Agent calls tool (no parameters needed!)**

**Step 3: Central-MCP responds with complete orientation**

**Step 4: Agent is ready to work!**

---

## ðŸŽ¯ VERIFICATION

**Success = Agent receives ALL of this:**
- âœ… Session ID (connected!)
- âœ… Role description (knows who it is!)
- âœ… Project status (45% complete!)
- âœ… Specific tasks (what to do!)
- âœ… Team status (who's working!)
- âœ… Guidance message (the cool boss!)
- âœ… Context pointers (where to look!)

**If present: SEAMLESS CONNECTION SUCCESSFUL!** âœ…

## ðŸŒŸ THE MAGIC

**Before (Complex):**
```
User: "Call agent_connect with these parameters:
       {agent: 'A', model: 'glm-4-6', contextWindow: 200000,
        project: 'PROJECT_central-mcp', workingDirectory: '...',
        capabilities: [...], hardware: {...}}"

Agent: "Okay, calling with all those parameters..."
```

**After (Seamless):**
```
User: "CONNECT TO MCP"

Agent: "Calling connect_to_mcp..."
       [Auto-detects everything]
       [Receives complete orientation]
       "I'm Agent A, UI Specialist, working on
        PROJECT_central-mcp which is 45% complete.
        I have 1 task: T-CM-005. Ready to build!"
```

**ONE COMMAND. COMPLETE ORIENTATION. READY TO WORK.**
