**Solutions:**
```
Provider           Auth Method              Status        Action Required
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Z.AI GLM-4.6       API Key                  ✅ READY      Already configured!
Anthropic Claude   API Key (not OAuth)      ⏳ PENDING    Get API key from console

**Architecture:**
```typescript
src/intelligence/
├── IntelligenceEngine.ts       // Main AI orchestrator
├── EventAnalyzer.ts            // Analyzes incoming events
├── PatternDetector.ts          // Detects agent/task patterns
├── OptimizationSuggestor.ts    // Suggests improvements
├── PredictionEngine.ts         // Predicts outcomes
└── InsightGenerator.ts         // Generates human insights
```

**Core Features:**
1. **Event Analysis** (Real-time)
   - Every event → AI analyzes for patterns
   - Detects: slowdowns, blockers, anomalies
   - Example: "Agent A stuck on T004 for 2 hours"

2. **Pattern Detection** (Historical)
   - Learns from event history
   - Identifies: agent strengths, task durations, bottlenecks
   - Example: "Agent A is 30% faster on UI tasks"

3. **Optimization Suggestions** (Proactive)
   - Suggests better routing rules
   - Recommends task reassignments
   - Example: "Move T015 from Agent C to Agent A (better match)"

4. **Outcome Prediction** (Predictive)
   - Estimates completion times
   - Predicts delays before they happen
   - Example: "T018 will complete in 3.2 hours (85% confidence)"

**Model Selection:**
```
Use Case                  Recommended Model           Why?
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Event Analysis            Z.AI GLM-4-Flash (200K)     Fast, already configured
Pattern Detection         Z.AI GLM-4-Plus (1M)        Large context for history
Optimization              Anthropic Sonnet-4.5        Best reasoning
Prediction                Google Gemini 2.5 Pro       Strong at forecasting
```

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// src/intelligence/IntelligenceEngine.ts
export class IntelligenceEngine {
  private models: {
    zai: ZAIClient;           // Event analysis (fast)
    anthropic: AnthropicClient; // Optimization (smart)
    gemini: GeminiClient;      // Prediction (accurate)
  };

  async analyzeEvent(event: Event): Promise<Insight> {
    // Route to appropriate model
    switch (event.type) {
      case 'agent_log':
      case 'agent_progress':
        return this.models.zai.analyze(event);  // Fast real-time

      case 'task_completed':
        return this.models.gemini.predict(event); // Learn patterns

      case 'rule_created':
        return this.models.anthropic.optimize(event); // Deep reasoning
    }
  }

  async suggestOptimization(): Promise<Suggestion> {
    // Analyze all recent events
    const events = eventBroadcaster.getRecentEvents(100);

    // Use Sonnet-4.5 for deep analysis
    return this.models.anthropic.analyzePatterns(events);
  }
}
```

**New Event Types:**
```typescript
intelligence_insight      // AI analysis result
optimization_suggestion   // AI suggests improvement

## 💡 KEY INSIGHTS

### **Critical Dependencies:**
1. **Authentication BLOCKS everything** → Must solve first
2. **AI Intelligence is foundation** → Phase 6 enables Phase 7-13
3. **Security is non-negotiable** → Required before Phase 9
4. **Scale before ecosystem** → Can't add plugins to slow system

### **Quick Wins:**
- Phase 6.1 (Auth): 2-4 hours → Unlocks AI
- Phase 6.2 (Intelligence): 2-3 days → 10x value
- Phase 7.1 (Mobile): 3-4 days → Reach mobile users

### **Long-term Bets:**
- Autonomous agents will change everything
- Swarm intelligence = breakthrough capability
- AGI integration = competitive advantage

## 🎉 THE COMPLETE VISION

**Starting Point (Today):**
- Manual coordination
- Static rules
- Human-in-loop
- Single project
- No AI intelligence

**End State (12 months):**
- Fully autonomous
- Self-learning
- Zero human intervention
- 100+ projects
- AGI-powered

**From:**
```
Human: "Build feature X"
System: "Here are 10 tasks, assign them manually"
Human: *Assigns tasks, monitors, debugs*
System: *Eventually completes*
```

**To:**
```
Human: "Build feature X"
System: *Analyzes requirement*
        *Generates architecture*
        *Assigns 50 tasks to 20 agents*
        *Agents self-organize into teams*
        *Build, test, deploy automatically*
        *Monitor, heal, optimize*
        "Feature X deployed to production, 98% test coverage, 50ms p95 latency"
Human: "Thanks!"
```
