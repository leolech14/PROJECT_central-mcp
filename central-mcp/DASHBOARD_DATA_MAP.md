## üéÆ AVAILABLE CONTROLS (What We Can Actually Do)

### SERVER CONTROLS

```bash
‚úÖ View Logs: tail /opt/central-mcp/logs/*.log
‚úÖ Restart Server: pkill node && node dist/index.js
‚úÖ Check Health: curl http://localhost:3000/health
‚úÖ Database Query: sqlite3 /opt/central-mcp/data/registry.db
```

### LOOP CONTROLS

```
‚è∏Ô∏è Enable/Disable Loop: Edit config, restart (no API yet)
‚è∏Ô∏è Trigger Manual Run: No API yet
‚è∏Ô∏è Adjust Interval: Edit config, restart
```

### TASK CONTROLS

```
Via Database:
‚úÖ View tasks: SELECT * FROM tasks
‚úÖ Update task status: UPDATE tasks SET status=...
‚è∏Ô∏è Claim task: Would need MCP tool call
‚è∏Ô∏è Complete task: Would need MCP tool call
```

### AGENT CONTROLS

```
‚úÖ View connected agents: SELECT * FROM agent_sessions
‚úÖ View agent history: Past sessions
‚è∏Ô∏è Send message to agent: Would need A2A integration
‚è∏Ô∏è Assign task: Would need MCP tool
```

   - Daily/monthly costs
   - Budget status
   - Free tier indicator
```

### CONTROLS (Need to Build):

```
‚è∏Ô∏è Authentication (Login required)
‚è∏Ô∏è Server restart button
‚è∏Ô∏è Log viewer (live tail)
‚è∏Ô∏è Manual loop trigger
‚è∏Ô∏è Task creation/assignment
‚è∏Ô∏è Agent messaging

Status: Not implemented yet
```

## üéØ WHAT'S REALISTIC FOR V1:

**Dashboard Can Show:**
```
‚úÖ Real-time VM health (from /health endpoint)
‚úÖ Loop execution counts (from auto_proactive_logs)
‚úÖ Task completion progress (from tasks table)
‚úÖ Agent connection history (from agent_sessions)
‚úÖ Database statistics (from table queries)
‚úÖ Cost tracking (from task_costs - currently $0)

= ALL READ-ONLY MONITORING
= NO AUTHENTICATION YET
= NO CONTROL ACTIONS YET
```

**Timeline:**
- Monitoring dashboard: 4 hours
- Authentication: +2 hours
- Control actions: +3 hours

---

## üéØ RECOMMENDATION:

**Build V1 (Monitoring Only) - 4 hours:**
- Real-time data display
- Visual progress bars
- Task completion tracking
- Loop status visualization
- All queryable data shown

**V2 Later (Controls) - +5 hours:**
- Authentication
- Server controls
- Task management
- Agent coordination

---

**Should I build the monitoring dashboard now (V1 - 4 hrs)?** üöÄ
