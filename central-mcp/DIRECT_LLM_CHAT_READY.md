**Status:** ‚úÖ **READY TO USE**
**Model:** GPT-4 Turbo (OpenAI)
**Interface:** Terminal CLI

---

## ‚ö° QUICK START (3 Ways to Chat)

### Method 1: Quick Launcher (Easiest)

```bash
cd /Users/lech/PROJECTS_all/PROJECT_central-mcp/central-mcp

# Interactive mode (like ChatGPT)
./scripts/llm

# Single question
./scripts/llm "How do I implement OAuth 2.0?"

# Complex question
./scripts/llm "Design a microservices architecture for an e-commerce platform"
```

### Method 2: Direct Script

```bash
cd /Users/lech/PROJECTS_all/PROJECT_central-mcp/central-mcp

# With Doppler (auto-loads API key)
doppler run --project ai-tools --config dev -- node scripts/chat-with-llm.js

# With environment variable
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-proj-biWy6h_E1fzGks8K..."
node scripts/chat-with-llm.js

# Single message
node scripts/chat-with-llm.js "Explain how REST APIs work"
```

### Method 3: Create Alias (Permanent Shortcut)

```bash
# Add to your ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc
echo 'alias llm="cd /Users/lech/PROJECTS_all/PROJECT_central-mcp/central-mcp && ./scripts/llm"' >> ~/.zshrc

# Reload shell
source ~/.zshrc

# Now use from ANYWHERE:
llm "What is the difference between TCP and UDP?"
llm  # Interactive mode
```

üí¨ You: Build me a REST API for managing books

ü§ñ GPT-4 Turbo:
I'll help you design a REST API for book management. Here's a comprehensive
specification:

## Endpoints

1. **GET /api/books** - List all books
2. **GET /api/books/:id** - Get specific book
3. **POST /api/books** - Create new book
4. **PUT /api/books/:id** - Update book
5. **DELETE /api/books/:id** - Delete book

## Data Model
[... continues streaming ...]

üí¨ You: What database should I use?

ü§ñ GPT-4 Turbo:
For a book management API, I'd recommend PostgreSQL because:

1. **Relational structure** - Books have clear relationships (authors, categories)
2. **ACID compliance** - Data integrity is crucial for inventory
3. **JSON support** - Can store metadata flexibly
[... continues ...]
```

üí¨ You: How do I implement OAuth 2.0?

ü§ñ GPT-4 Turbo:

OAuth 2.0 is an authorization framework that enables applications to obtain
limited access to user accounts. Here's a comprehensive guide:

## Core Concepts

1. **Authorization Server** - Issues tokens after authenticating the user
2. **Resource Server** - Hosts protected resources
3. **Client** - Application requesting access
4. **Resource Owner** - User who owns the data

## Implementation Flow

[Authorization Code Flow - Most Secure]

1. **User clicks "Login with OAuth"**
   - Client redirects to authorization server
   - URL: `https://auth.example.com/authorize?
          client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&
          redirect_uri=https://yourapp.com/callback&
          response_type=code&
          scope=read write`

üí¨ You: Design a microservices architecture

ü§ñ GPT-4 Turbo:

I'll design a comprehensive microservices architecture for you:

## Core Services

1. **API Gateway** (Kong/AWS API Gateway)
   - Entry point for all requests
   - Rate limiting, authentication
   - Request routing

2. **User Service**
   - User authentication & authorization
   - Profile management
   - JWT token generation

[... continues ...]

üí¨ You: How do I handle inter-service communication?

ü§ñ GPT-4 Turbo:

Great question! For microservices communication, you have two main patterns:

1. **Synchronous (REST/gRPC)**
