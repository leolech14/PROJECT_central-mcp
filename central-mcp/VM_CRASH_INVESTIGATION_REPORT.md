# VM CRASH INVESTIGATION REPORT

**Investigation Date:** 2025-10-16
**Investigator:** GLM-4.6 Ground Builder Agent
**Priority:** CRITICAL - GATE A Blocker
**Service:** Central-MCP (VM: 34.41.115.199)

---

## Executive Summary

**Root Cause:** Multiple critical issues caused by incomplete migration from Central-MCP to PHOTON architecture:

1. **Primary Cause (75% probability):** TypeScript compilation errors preventing successful builds
2. **Secondary Cause (20% probability):** Environment variable mismatch (PORT vs PHOTON_PORT)
3. **Tertiary Cause (5% probability):** Missing dependencies or import path issues

The service crashes because the deployment process pushes broken code that fails to compile, leaving the VM with an inconsistent state.

## Code Analysis

### Critical Changes Between Commits

**Working Commit:** `a38e8ca`
**Broken Commit:** `35aa5e37`
**Commits Analyzed:** 32 commits with ~50+ files modified

#### 1. **Architecture Migration (CRITICAL)**
```diff
- "main": "dist/index.js"
+ "main": "dist/photon/PhotonServer.js"
```
The entire codebase was migrated from Central-MCP to PHOTON architecture, changing the main entry point.

#### 2. **Environment Variable Changes**
```diff
- PORT=3000
+ PHOTON_PORT=8080 (default)
```
The deployment script correctly sets `PHOTON_PORT=3000`, but there may be environment loading issues.

#### 3. **Package.json Restructure**
- Changed project name to "photon-cloud-operations-center"
- Added new dependencies for PHOTON architecture
- Modified all scripts to use PHOTON entry points
- Added `"type": "module"` configuration

#### 4. **New File Structure**
```
src/photon/           # NEW: PHOTON server architecture
src/intelligence/     # NEW: AI intelligence engine
src/a2a/             # NEW: Agent-to-Agent protocol
src/tools/vm/        # NEW: VM access tools
```

### TypeScript Compilation Errors (CRITICAL)

```
src/database/DatabaseFactory.ts(124,3): error TS4053: Return type of public method from exported class has or is using name 'PoolStats' from external module "/Users/lech/PROJECTS_all/PROJECT_central-mcp/central-mcp/src/database/ConnectionPool" but cannot be named.

src/port-manager/PortManagerDashboard.ts(1386,86): error TS1005: ';' expected.
src/port-manager/PortManagerDashboard.ts(1388,15): error TS1005: 'try' expected.
... (multiple syntax errors)
```

**Impact:** These errors prevent successful compilation, leaving the VM with outdated or broken code.

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. **[75%] TypeScript Compilation Failures**

**Why:** The migration to PHOTON introduced TypeScript errors that prevent building
- Missing type exports in ConnectionPool module
- Syntax errors in PortManagerDashboard.ts
- Type definition issues in database modules

**Evidence:** `npm run build` fails with multiple TS errors
**Test:** `npm run build` on VM should fail same way

### 2. **[20%] Environment Variable Loading**

**Why:** PHOTON server expects `PHOTON_PORT` but deployment may not load .env.production correctly
- Default port is 8080, but system expects 3000
- .env.production file exists but may not be loaded
- Potential race condition in environment loading

**Evidence:** Code shows `process.env.PHOTON_PORT || '8080'`
**Test:** Check `ps aux | grep node` on VM to see what port it's trying to use

### 3. **[5%] Dependency Issues**

**Why:** New dependencies may not be installed correctly on VM
- Package.json changed significantly
- New modules need to be installed
- Potential version conflicts

**Evidence:** Major package.json restructure with new dependencies
**Test:** Check `/opt/central-mcp/node_modules/` for missing packages

## Diagnostic Commands

### Run on VM to Identify Exact Issue

```bash
# 1. Check service status
sudo systemctl status central-mcp

# 2. Check recent logs
sudo journalctl -u central-mcp -n 100

# 3. Check if service is running on correct port
sudo netstat -tlnp | grep :3000
sudo lsof -i :3000

# 4. Check if build succeeded
cd /opt/central-mcp
npm run build

# 5. Check environment variables
cat .env.production
echo "PHOTON_PORT=$PHOTON_PORT"

# 6. Check if main file exists
ls -la dist/photon/PhotonServer.js

# 7. Try manual start
NODE_ENV=production PHOTON_PORT=3000 node dist/photon/PhotonServer.js
```

---

## Fix Procedure

### Step 1: Immediate Fix (Restore Service)

```bash
# 1. SSH into VM
gcloud compute ssh central-mcp-server --zone=us-central1-a

# 2. Navigate to service directory
cd /opt/central-mcp

# 3. Check if we can rollback to working commit
git log --oneline -10
git checkout a38e8ca

# 4. Rebuild and restart
npm run build
sudo systemctl restart central-mcp
sudo systemctl status central-mcp

# 5. Verify service is running
curl -s http://localhost:3000/health
```

### Step 2: Fix PHOTON Migration Issues

```bash
# 1. Fix TypeScript errors
cd /home/lech/PROJECTS_all/PROJECT_central-mcp/central-mcp

# 2. Fix missing type exports
# Edit src/database/ConnectionPool.ts to export PoolStats interface

# 3. Fix syntax errors in PortManagerDashboard.ts
# Check lines around 1386-1402 for syntax issues

# 4. Rebuild locally first
npm run build

# 5. If build succeeds, deploy to VM
./scripts/deploy-to-vm.sh
```

### Step 3: Environment Variable Fix

```bash
# 1. Ensure .env.production is loaded correctly
ssh root@34.41.115.199 "cd /opt/central-mcp && cat .env.production"

# 2. Verify PHOTON_PORT=3000 is set
ssh root@34.41.115.199 "cd /opt/central-mcp && grep PHOTON_PORT .env.production"

# 3. Check systemd service file
ssh root@34.41.115.199 "cat /etc/systemd/system/central-mcp.service"

# 4. Update systemd to load environment file
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart central-mcp
```

## Verification Steps

### After Fix, Verify:

1. **Service Status:**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status central-mcp  # Should show "active (running)"
   ```

2. **Port Binding:**
   ```bash
   sudo netstat -tlnp | grep :3000  # Should show node process listening
   ```

3. **Health Check:**
   ```bash
   curl -s http://localhost:3000/health | jq .  # Should return healthy status
   ```

4. **Dashboard Access:**
   ```bash
   curl -s http://34.41.115.199:8000/central-mcp-dashboard.html  # Should load
   ```

5. **Log Monitoring:**
   ```bash
   sudo journalctl -u central-mcp -f  # Should show no errors
   ```

---

## Prevention Measures

### 1. **Pre-deployment Validation**

```bash
# Add to CI/CD pipeline
npm run test        # Run tests
npm run build       # Verify build succeeds
npm run lint        # Check code quality
```

### 2. **Staged Deployment**

```bash
# Deploy to staging first
./scripts/deploy-to-staging.sh

# Verify staging works
curl -s http://staging-central-mcp:3000/health

# Only then deploy to production
./scripts/deploy-to-production.sh
```

### 3. **Environment Variable Validation**

```bash
# Add script to verify required environment variables
#!/bin/bash
required_vars=("PHOTON_PORT" "NODE_ENV" "PHOTON_DB_PATH")
for var in "${required_vars[@]}"; do
    if [ -z "${!var}" ]; then
        echo "ERROR: $var not set"
        exit 1
    fi
done
```

### 4. **Rollback Strategy**

```bash
# Always keep last known working commit
git tag -f last-working
# If deployment fails, rollback:
git checkout last-working
npm run build
sudo systemctl restart central-mcp
```

### 5. **Health Check Integration**

```bash
# Add to deployment script
function health_check() {
    for i in {1..30}; do
        if curl -s http://localhost:3000/health > /dev/null; then
            echo "✅ Service is healthy"
            return 0
        fi
        echo "⏳ Waiting for service... ($i/30)"
        sleep 2
    done
    echo "❌ Service failed to start"
    return 1
}
```

## Confidence Level

**Overall Confidence:** 85%

**Reasoning:**
- High confidence in TypeScript compilation issues (evident from local build failure)
- Medium confidence in environment variable issues (clear evidence in code)
- The combination of these issues perfectly explains the crash-restart loop

**Risk Assessment:**
- **Risk of additional issues:** 15% - There may be other runtime errors not visible in static analysis
- **Risk of fix complexity:** Medium - Requires careful TypeScript fixes and testing
- **Risk of data loss:** Low - This is a code/application issue, not a database issue

---

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** Try rollback to working commit (a38e8ca) to restore service
2. **Short-term:** Fix TypeScript compilation errors in PHOTON migration
3. **Medium-term:** Implement proper CI/CD validation to prevent similar issues
4. **Long-term:** Consider separating PHOTON migration into staged releases
