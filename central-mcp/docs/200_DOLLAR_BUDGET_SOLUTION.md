```

**Just $3.70 over budget - easily adjustable!**

---

### **Adjusted to Exact $200/month:**

```yaml
Central-MCP Server (N2D-Standard-2, 1-year):

## üöÄ DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY FOR $200/MONTH

### **Phase 1: Deploy with Free Trial**

```bash
# Create Central-MCP server (commitment starts AFTER trial)
gcloud compute instances create central-mcp-server \
  --zone=us-central1-a \
  --machine-type=n2d-standard-2 \
  --boot-disk-size=100GB \
  --boot-disk-type=pd-ssd

# Create Agent #1 (powerful)
gcloud compute instances create central-mcp-agent-A \
  --zone=us-central1-a \
  --machine-type=n2d-standard-4 \
  --boot-disk-size=100GB \
  --boot-disk-type=pd-ssd

# Create Agent #2 (light)
gcloud compute instances create central-mcp-agent-B \
  --zone=us-central1-a \
  --machine-type=n2d-standard-2 \
  --boot-disk-size=30GB \
  --boot-disk-type=pd-ssd
```

**Cost during free trial: $0** ‚úÖ

---

### **Phase 2: After 3 Months - Activate 1-Year Commitment**

```bash
# Purchase 1-year committed use contract
gcloud compute commitments create central-mcp-commitment \
  --region=us-central1 \
  --plan=12-month \
  --resources=vcpu=8,memory=32GB
```

**This locks in 37% discount for 1 year!**

## üí° COST OPTIMIZATION TIPS

### **Tip 1: Use Preemptible VMs for Development**

**Preemptible = 80% cheaper!**

```yaml
Agent #2 as Preemptible (can be shut down by Google):
  N2D-Standard-2 (preemptible): $12.32/month (was $61.61!)
  Savings: $49.29/month!

New Total: $200.30 - $38.81 + $12.32 = $173.81/month
Budget remaining: $26.19/month

Use savings for:
  - Bigger disk (200 GB instead of 100 GB)
  - More network egress
  - Reserve for occasional overages
```

**When to use preemptible:**
- ‚úÖ Development/testing agents (can restart if interrupted)
- ‚ùå Central-MCP server (must stay up 24/7!)
- ‚ùå Production agents (need reliability)

---

### **Tip 2: Use Spot VMs (Newer, Better than Preemptible)**

**Spot VMs = 60-91% cheaper, more stable!**

```yaml
Agent #2 as Spot VM:
  N2D-Standard-2 (spot): $18.48/month (was $61.61!)
  Savings: $43.13/month!
  More stable than preemptible!
```

---

### **Tip 3: Scale Storage Over Time**

**Start small, grow as needed:**

```yaml
Initial:
  Central-MCP: 50 GB (enough for database)
  Agent #1: 50 GB (enough for projects)
  Agent #2: 30 GB (minimal)
  Cost: $22.10/month storage

Later (when needed):
  Expand to 100 GB per VM
  Cost: $42.50/month storage
```

## üéØ ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION:

### **"IF I PAY 1 YEAR IN ADVANCE ITS CHEAP???"**

# ‚úÖ YES! 37% CHEAPER!

**But you DON'T pay 1 year in advance!**

You just **COMMIT** to using it for 1 year, and Google gives you 37% discount on monthly bills!

**How it works:**
1. You commit: "I'll use this for 1 year"
2. Google gives you: 37% discount every month
3. You pay: Monthly (not upfront!)
4. Total savings: 37% √ó 12 months = $700-900/year saved!

**Example:**
- Without commitment: $309/month √ó 12 = $3,708/year
- With 1-year commitment: $200/month √ó 12 = $2,400/year
- **Savings: $1,308/year!** üí∞
