## 🔍 IMPORTANT DETAILS

### **What's Included (Always Free):**

```yaml
Compute Engine:
  ✅ 1 E2-micro VM per month
  ✅ 30 GB standard persistent disk
  ✅ 1 GB snapshot storage
  ✅ 1 GB network egress (NA)
  ✅ All in: us-west1, us-central1, us-east1

Additional Always Free (Other Services):
  ✅ Cloud Storage: 5 GB standard storage
  ✅ Cloud Functions: 2 million invocations
  ✅ Cloud Run: 2 million requests
  ✅ Firestore: 1 GB storage
  ✅ BigQuery: 1 TB queries/month
```

**These are ALWAYS FREE - not trial, not temporary!**

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT LIMITATIONS

### **1. Region Restriction:**
```
ONLY these 3 regions are free:
  ✅ us-west1 (Oregon)
  ✅ us-central1 (Iowa)
  ✅ us-east1 (South Carolina)

If you use any other region:
  ❌ You will be charged!
```

### **2. One VM Only:**
```
Free tier includes:
  ✅ 1 E2-micro VM (free)
  ❌ 2nd E2-micro VM (charged!)

You can only have 1 free E2-micro running at a time.
```

### **3. Disk Limit:**
```
Free disk:
  ✅ 30 GB standard persistent disk (HDD)
  ❌ SSD costs extra ($0.17/GB/month)

If you use 50 GB:
  First 30 GB: Free
  Extra 20 GB: $3.40/month
```

### **4. Network Egress:**
```
Free network (to North America):
  ✅ First 1 GB/month: Free
  ❌ Over 1 GB: $0.12/GB

Typical usage:
  Light: <1 GB = Free ✅
  Moderate: 10 GB = $1.08/month
  Heavy: 100 GB = $11.88/month
```

## 💰 REALISTIC COSTS FOR CENTRAL-MCP

### **Best Case (Minimal Usage):**
```yaml
E2-micro VM: $0/month (free tier!)
30 GB disk: $0/month (free tier!)
<1 GB network: $0/month (free tier!)

TOTAL: $0/month 🎉
```

### **Typical Case (Light Usage):**
```yaml
E2-micro VM: $0/month (free tier!)
30 GB disk: $0/month (free tier!)
~5 GB network: $0.48/month
External IP (if used): $0/month (attached)

TOTAL: $0.48/month ≈ FREE! 🎉
```

### **Heavy Case (More Storage):**
```yaml
E2-micro VM: $0/month (free tier!)
50 GB disk: $3.40/month (20 GB over free tier)
~10 GB network: $1.08/month

TOTAL: $4.48/month (still very cheap!)
```

## 🎯 PERFECT FOR CENTRAL-MCP SERVER!

**Why E2-micro is enough for Central-MCP:**

```yaml
Central-MCP Needs:
  • Coordinate agents (low CPU)
  • Run SQLite database (low memory)
  • WebSocket connections (low network)
  • MCP protocol (lightweight)

E2-micro Provides:
  ✅ 0.25-2 vCPUs (burstable - enough!)
  ✅ 1 GB RAM (enough for Node.js + SQLite)
  ✅ 30 GB disk (plenty for database)
  ✅ Network (coordination is lightweight)

Perfect match! ✅
```

**What runs on E2-micro:**
- ✅ Central-MCP MCP server
- ✅ SQLite database (conversations, tasks, agents)
- ✅ Task coordination
- ✅ Auto-task creation
- ✅ Thread auto-save system

**What DOESN'T run on E2-micro:**
- ❌ Agent workloads (use separate VMs for agents!)
- ❌ Heavy processing (spec generation on agent VMs)
- ❌ Large builds (agents do this)

---

## 🚀 OPTIMAL ARCHITECTURE

### **FREE TIER SETUP ($49/month total):**

```yaml
Central-MCP (E2-micro - FREE!):
  ├── MCP server (coordinates everything)
  ├── SQLite database (stores everything)
  ├── Task registry
  ├── Agent registry
  └── Cost: $0/month ✅

Agent A (E2-standard-4 preemptible):
  ├── Cursor IDE
  ├── Git operations
  ├── Heavy processing
  ├── Spec generation
  └── Cost: $46/month

Network: $3/month

TOTAL: $49/month
```

**Central-MCP free forever, pay only for agents!**

---

## ✅ VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

**To ensure you stay in free tier:**

- [ ] Use only 1 E2-micro VM
- [ ] Deploy in us-west1, us-central1, or us-east1
- [ ] Keep disk ≤ 30 GB (or pay $0.17/GB for extra)
- [ ] Use standard persistent disk (not SSD)
- [ ] Keep network egress low (<1 GB to stay free)
- [ ] Don't upgrade to E2-small or larger

**If you follow these rules: $0/month FOREVER!** ✅

---

## 🎁 FREE TIER + FREE TRIAL = DOUBLE FREE!

**Crazy savings:**

```
Month 1-3:
  • $300 free trial credit
  • E2-micro already free
  • Credit goes to Agent VM
  • Agent VM: $0 (using trial credit)
  • Central-MCP: $0 (free tier)
  TOTAL: $0 🤯

Month 4+:
  • Free trial expired
  • E2-micro still free! ✅
  • Agent VM: $46/month (preemptible)
  • Central-MCP: $0 (free tier forever!)
  TOTAL: $46/month
```

**You get 3 months to test completely free, then only pay for agents!**

## 🔒 LIMITATIONS TO WATCH

### **Performance:**
```
E2-micro CPU:
  • 0.25 vCPUs baseline
  • Can burst to 2 vCPUs (temporarily)
  • If you use too much CPU continuously, throttled

Good for:
  ✅ MCP coordination (low CPU)
  ✅ Database queries (occasional)
  ✅ Task assignment (lightweight)

Not good for:
  ❌ Video encoding
  ❌ Heavy compilation
  ❌ ML training
  ❌ Running multiple agents on same VM
```

### **Memory:**
```
1 GB RAM:
  • ~700 MB available after OS
  • Node.js + SQLite: ~400-500 MB
  • Remaining: ~200-300 MB buffer

Good for:
  ✅ Central-MCP server
  ✅ Lightweight coordination

Not good for:
  ❌ Running agents (need 8-16 GB)
  ❌ Heavy caching
```

## 💡 PRO TIPS

### **Tip 1: Use Cloud Shell for Management**
```
Google Cloud Shell (also free!):
  • Free VM for 50 hours/week
  • Use for deploying/managing
  • No cost for administration
```

### **Tip 2: Monitor Usage**
```
Set up billing alerts:
  • Alert at $1/month
  • Alert at $5/month
  • Catch any unexpected charges early
```

### **Tip 3: Optimize Network**
```
Reduce network egress:
  • Keep agents in same region as Central-MCP
  • Internal communication is free!
  • Only external traffic costs money
```
