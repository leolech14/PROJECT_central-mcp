## 🌟 LECH'S VISION

> "We must focus on an extremely important functionality - it will be at the center of all this comprehensive technology assembly. **The simplest act, to rival the most sophisticated ones → WRITING**."

> "We need a clear, modular system that will register EVERY SINGLE PIECE of information within our reach. If we can be well-organized, then we can store EVERYTHING! We just need to structure our schemas so that it is stored in a USEFUL, SELF-EXPLANATORY, DOMAIN-SPECIFIC set of information."

> "This will be the SOURCE OF SYSTEM STATUS UPDATES. And we can use a DETERMINISTIC LAYER OF ANALYSIS that will DISTILL the comprehensive amount of data we store into MORE HIGH-DENSITY sets of tokens."

## 🎯 THE CORE PHILOSOPHY

### Everything Is An Event

**Not a giant unstructured log, but domain-specific structured events:**

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  TRADITIONAL LOGGING (Chaos)                             │
│  → One giant log file                                    │
│  → Unstructured text                                     │
│  → Hard to search                                        │
│  → Can't analyze                                         │
│  → Information lost                                      │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  UNIVERSAL WRITE SYSTEM (Order)                          │
│  → Domain-specific event tables                          │
│  → Structured schemas                                    │
│  → Self-explanatory                                      │
│  → Easy to query                                         │
│  → Information preserved forever                         │
│  → Automatic analysis                                    │

## 🗄️ THE ARCHITECTURE

### 5 Domain-Specific Event Tables

**1. Specification Events** (`spec_events`)
- What: What happens to specifications
- Examples: created, updated, gap_detected, gap_resolved, validated, completed

**2. Task Events** (`task_events`)
- What: What happens to tasks
- Examples: created, assigned, started, completed, blocked, unblocked, failed

**3. Code Generation Events** (`code_generation_events`)
- What: What happens during code generation
- Examples: generation_started, template_applied, file_created, build_passed, build_failed

**4. Interview Events** (`interview_events`)
- What: What happens during user interviews
- Examples: session_started, question_asked, question_answered, gap_resolved, session_completed

**5. Agent Activity Events** (`agent_activity_events`)
- What: What agents do
- Examples: connected, disconnected, task_claimed, task_completed, context_received

**6. System Status Events** (`system_status_events`)
- What: System-level events
- Examples: loop_execution, migration_run, backup_created, health_check

---

### Self-Explanatory Schemas

**Every event captures:**
- **WHO**: `event_actor` - Who/what caused this
- **WHAT**: `event_action` - What specifically happened
- **WHEN**: `event_timestamp` - Exactly when
- **WHY**: `triggered_by` - What triggered this
- **WHERE**: Domain-specific fields (spec_id, task_id, etc.)
- **IMPACT**: `impact_level` + `impact_description`
- **BEFORE/AFTER**: `state_before` + `state_after` + `delta`
- **CONTEXT**: `related_entities` + `tags` + `metadata`

**You can understand what happened just by looking at the schema!**

---

## 📊 STATUS AGGREGATION: FROM EVENTS TO INSIGHTS

### Current System Status (High-Density Summary)

**One table (`current_system_status`) that answers:**
- What's the overall system health?
- How many specs/tasks/codebases exist?
- How many are complete vs in-progress?
- How many agents are active?
- What's the quality score?
- What happened in the last 24 hours?

**Automatically updated by triggers!**

```sql
-- Every event automatically updates system status
CREATE TRIGGER update_status_on_spec_event
AFTER INSERT ON spec_events
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    UPDATE current_system_status
    SET last_updated = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
        events_last_24h = (COUNT from spec_events)
    WHERE status_id = 'current';
END;
```

---

### Status Snapshots (Historical Tracking)

**Capture complete system state at any moment:**
- Scheduled snapshots (daily, weekly)
- On-demand snapshots (before deployments)
- Critical event snapshots (major system changes)

**Result:** Time-travel through system history!

---

## 🔬 DETERMINISTIC ANALYSIS: DISTILL TO INSIGHTS

### Activity Patterns (What's happening regularly)

**The system detects patterns automatically:**
```
Pattern: "Daily Specification Creation"
Detection: New specs created regularly
Impact: Healthy - indicates active development
Recommendation: Continue monitoring, ensure quality
```

```
Pattern: "Task Completion Velocity"
Detection: Tasks completed at steady rate
Impact: Indicates productivity
Recommendation: Track trends, identify bottlenecks if velocity drops
```

```
Pattern: "Gap Resolution Rate"
Detection: Interview gaps resolved quickly
Impact: Interview system is effective
Recommendation: Optimize templates if rate is low
```

---

### Insights (High-Density Distilled Information)

**From 10,000 events → 5 critical insights:**

```
Insight: "Specification Quality Improving"
Type: Trend
Evidence: Last 10 specs have 90%+ completeness
Confidence: 0.95
Recommendation: Continue current interview process
```

```
Insight: "Task Blocker Detected"
Type: Warning
Evidence: 15 tasks blocked on same dependency
Confidence: 1.0
Recommendation: Resolve T-PROJECT-005 immediately
```

```
Insight: "Code Quality Excellent"
Type: Achievement
Evidence: All codebases >0.9 quality score
Confidence: 1.0
Recommendation: Document best practices used
```

**The system thinks for you!**

## 🔥 THE POWER: COMPREHENSIVE DATA → HIGH-DENSITY INSIGHTS

### Example: From 1000 Events to 3 Insights

**Raw Events (1000+ in last 24 hours):**
- 150 spec events
- 300 task events
- 250 code gen events
- 100 interview events
- 150 agent events
- 50 system events

**Deterministic Analysis:**
```
Rule 1: IF task completion rate > 90% AND code quality > 0.85
        THEN generate insight: "Development Velocity High"

Rule 2: IF spec completeness increased by >30% in 24h
        THEN generate insight: "Specification Quality Improving"

Rule 3: IF >5 tasks blocked on same dependency
        THEN generate insight: "Critical Blocker Detected"
```

**Distilled Insights (3 high-density insights):**
```
1. ✅ Development Velocity High
   Evidence: 45 tasks completed, 98% success rate, avg quality 0.91
   Recommendation: Maintain current pace

2. ✅ Specification Quality Improving
   Evidence: Completeness increased from 40% to 75% in 24h
   Recommendation: Continue interview process

3. ⚠️ Critical Blocker Detected
   Evidence: 8 tasks blocked on T-MINERALS-005
   Recommendation: Prioritize T-MINERALS-005 immediately
```

**From 1000 events → 3 actionable insights!**

## 💡 BEST PRACTICES

### 1. Write Everything
Don't filter - write ALL events. Storage is cheap, lost information is expensive.

### 2. Use Appropriate Impact Levels
- **low**: Routine operations
- **medium**: Notable events
- **high**: Important milestones
- **critical**: System-critical events

### 3. Include Context
Always fill `related_entities`, `tags`, `metadata` - makes analysis powerful.

### 4. Capture Before/After State
When possible, include `state_before` and `state_after` - enables delta analysis.

### 5. Use Descriptive Actions
`event_action` should be human-readable and specific.

### 6. Tag Consistently
Use consistent tags across domains for cross-domain analysis.
