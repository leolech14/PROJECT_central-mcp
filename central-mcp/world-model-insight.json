System should actively extract information, provide context (project overview, achievements, team status), and integrate agents into labor effort. FUTURE MODE: NPC agents deployed on GCLOUD VM for 24/7 autonomous operation. Central-MCP must know when user is present vs autonomous operation, understand connection types, provide adaptive behavior, and model different operational contexts correctly.",
