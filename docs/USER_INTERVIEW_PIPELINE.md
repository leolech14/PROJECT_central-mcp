## 🌟 THE VISION: PROACTIVE GAP RESOLUTION

**Lech's Breakthrough Insight:**
> "The system must automatically, proactively identify gaps in specifications. To do this, we need a clear understanding of what ANY project needs to become possible, coherent. Then we can intelligently interview users with minimal questions that resolve maximum gaps."

**The Power:**

## 🧬 THE 10 UNIVERSAL PROJECT DIMENSIONS

**Every project needs these dimensions to be "complete" and actionable:**

### 1. **Purpose & Vision** (Priority: 100 - CRITICAL)
**What it captures:**
- Why does this project exist?
- What problem does it solve?
- What is the desired outcome?

**Why critical:**
Without clear purpose, team can't make aligned decisions or prioritize features

**Gap indicators:**
- Spec has no "why" statement
- Unclear what problem is being solved
- No vision statement

**Discovery questions:**
1. "What problem are you trying to solve with this project?"
2. "Who experiences this problem and how does it affect them?"
3. "What would success look like? How would you know the problem is solved?"
4. "What is the core value this project will provide?"

---

### 2. **Target Users** (Priority: 95 - CRITICAL)
**What it captures:**
- Who will use this?
- What are their needs?
- What are their pain points?

4. "Any design language or style guidelines to follow?"

---

### 7. **Data & Content** (Priority: 70 - HIGH)
**What it captures:**

## 🎯 THE INTELLIGENT INTERVIEW PROCESS

### Phase 1: Automatic Gap Detection

**System scans spec against 10 universal dimensions:**
```sql
FOR EACH dimension IN universal_project_schema:
  IF spec does NOT contain dimension information:
    CREATE gap WITH severity = dimension.gap_severity
    PRIORITIZE gap BY dimension.priority
END FOR
```

**Gap Types:**
- **MISSING**: Dimension not addressed at all
- **INCOMPLETE**: Dimension partially addressed
- **UNCLEAR**: Dimension mentioned but ambiguous
- **CONTRADICTORY**: Dimension has conflicting information

**Gap Severity:**
- **CRITICAL**: Blocks all work
- **HIGH**: Blocks major features
- **MEDIUM**: Blocks some tasks
- **LOW**: Minor impact

---

### Phase 2: Intelligent Question Prioritization

**Minimal Questions = Maximum Resolution**

**The Algorithm:**
1. **Group gaps by dimension** (multiple gaps per dimension)
2. **Prioritize by urgency** (CRITICAL > HIGH > MEDIUM > LOW)
3. **Identify blocking gaps** (gaps that block tasks)
4. **Select best questions** (questions that resolve multiple gaps)
5. **Order logically** (natural conversation flow)

**Example:**
```
Spec has 15 gaps across 7 dimensions

Instead of 15 questions:
→ Ask 4 strategic questions that resolve all 15 gaps

Question 1 (Purpose): Resolves 3 gaps
Question 2 (Users): Resolves 4 gaps
Question 3 (Features): Resolves 6 gaps
Question 4 (Tech Stack): Resolves 2 gaps

Result: 4 questions → 15 gaps resolved
Efficiency: 3.75 gaps per question
```

---

### Phase 3: Structured Interview Execution

**Interview Flow:**
```
1. Introduction
   → Explain purpose of interview
   → Set expectations (time, format)
   → Build trust

2. Discovery Questions
   → Start with high-level (Purpose, Vision)
   → Move to specifics (Features, Users)
   → Ask follow-ups as needed

3. Clarification
   → Confirm understanding
   → Resolve ambiguities
   → Validate assumptions

4. Validation
   → Recap key information
   → Verify completeness
   → Identify any remaining gaps

5. Closure
   → Thank participant
   → Explain next steps
   → Schedule follow-up if needed
```

---

### Phase 4: Answer Processing & Spec Updates

**From Answers to Spec:**
```
User Answer → Structured Data → Spec Updates

Example:
Q: "What problem are you solving?"
A: "Mineral collectors can't track their collections easily,
    and there's no way to filter or search by properties like
    hardness or color."

Processing:
→ Problem: Collection tracking difficulty
→ Target Users: Mineral collectors
→ Pain Points: No filtering, no search
→ Core Features: Tracking, filtering, search
→ Data Needs: Minerals with properties (hardness, color)

Spec Updates:
→ PURPOSE dimension: COMPLETE
→ TARGET USERS dimension: PARTIAL (need more user details)
→ CORE FEATURES dimension: PARTIAL (need MVP prioritization)
→ DATA & CONTENT dimension: PARTIAL (need full schema)

Gaps Resolved: 1 CRITICAL, 2 HIGH
Gaps Created: 0
Gaps Remaining: 11
```

---

## 📊 COMPLETENESS SCORING

**Spec Completeness = % of Dimensions Fully Specified**

```
Completeness Score = (Complete Dimensions / Total Dimensions) × 100

Example:
10 dimensions required
7 dimensions complete
3 dimensions have gaps

Completeness = (7 / 10) × 100 = 70%
```

**Thresholds:**
- **90-100%**: Excellent - Ready for development
- **75-89%**: Good - Minor gaps remain
- **50-74%**: Fair - Significant gaps
- **0-49%**: Poor - Critical gaps

## 🎯 BEST PRACTICES

### 1. Always Start with Universal Dimensions
Don't invent new dimensions - use the 10 universal ones. They're battle-tested and comprehensive.

### 2. Prioritize Blocking Gaps
Resolve CRITICAL and HIGH gaps first. MEDIUM and LOW can wait.

### 3. Ask Open-Ended Questions
"What problem are you solving?" > "Is this a productivity tool?"

### 4. Confirm Understanding
Repeat back what you heard to validate understanding.

### 5. Track Question Effectiveness
Which questions resolve most gaps? Use those more.

### 6. Iterate Interview Templates
Continuously improve templates based on effectiveness data.

### 7. Don't Over-Interview
Stop when completeness > 90%. Perfect is the enemy of good.
