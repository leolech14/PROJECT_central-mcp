## ✅ WHAT I KNOW (Evidence-Based)

### Hard Facts (100% Certain)

```
✅ VERIFIED BY TESTING:
   - curl http://34.41.115.199:3000/health → No response
   - curl http://34.41.115.199:8000/ → 404 or not found
   - Ports 3000, 8000 not responding

✅ FROM CHATGPT CONSOLIDATION (You provided):
   - "Central-MCP service in crash-restart loop"
   - "Stuck on old commit (a38e8ca)"
   - "Fails on new commit (35aa5e37)"
   - "Root cause unknown - requires log investigation"

✅ FROM CODE ANALYSIS:
   - Service should be at /opt/central-mcp/
   - Systemd service name: central-mcp
   - Auto-sync script exists: /home/lech/auto-sync-central-mcp.sh
   - Cron configured: */5 * * * *
   - Git sync pulls from GitHub to /opt/central-mcp/
```

---

## ❌ WHAT I DON'T KNOW (Speculation Zone!)

### Critical Unknowns (0% Certain - Need Investigation!)

```
❌ ACTUAL ERROR MESSAGES:
   - What do the service logs say?
   - What error is causing the crash?
   - Is it startup failure or runtime crash?

❌ SERVICE STATE:
   - Is systemd trying to restart?
   - How many times has it crashed?
   - When did it last run successfully?

❌ ENVIRONMENT ISSUES:
   - Are npm dependencies installed?
   - Is Node.js version correct?
   - Are environment variables set?
   - Is the database accessible?

❌ CODE COMPATIBILITY:
   - What changed between a38e8ca and 35aa5e37?
   - Is there a syntax error?
   - Is there a dependency conflict?
   - Did database schema change?

❌ INFRASTRUCTURE:
   - Are ports 3000, 8000 bound correctly?
   - Is firewall blocking?
   - Is nginx/reverse proxy configured?
   - Is VM out of memory/disk?

❌ SYNC STATUS:
   - Did the cron sync actually pull new code?
   - Is /opt/central-mcp/ up to date?
   - Did rsync complete successfully?
   - Did npm install run?
```

## 🎯 LIKELY CAUSES (Educated Guesses - 40% Confidence)

### Top 5 Probable Issues

```
1. DEPENDENCY MISMATCH (40% probability)
   - package.json updated
   - npm install didn't run or failed
   - Missing node_modules
   - Incompatible Node.js version

2. DATABASE MIGRATION (30% probability)
   - Schema changed between commits
   - Migration didn't run
   - Database locked or corrupted
   - SQLite file permissions

3. ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES (20% probability)
   - Missing .env file
   - API keys not set
   - PORT configuration wrong
   - Database path incorrect

4. SYNTAX/RUNTIME ERROR (5% probability)
   - TypeScript compilation failed
   - Runtime error in new code
   - Import path broken
   - Async error on startup

5. RESOURCE EXHAUSTION (5% probability)
   - Out of memory
   - Out of disk space
   - Port already in use
   - Process limit reached
```

## 🔍 HOW TO FIND OUT (The Right Way!)

### STEP 1: Access the VM

```bash
# SSH to VM
gcloud compute ssh lech@central-mcp-server --zone=us-central1-a

# Or if different name:
gcloud compute ssh lech@{VM_NAME} --zone=us-central1-a

# Or direct SSH if IP known:
ssh lech@34.41.115.199
```

**Can I do this?** ❌ NO - Requires your gcloud credentials

### STEP 2: Check Service Status

```bash
# Once on VM:

# Check systemd status
sudo systemctl status central-mcp

# Expected output will show:
# - ● central-mcp.service - [description]
# - Active: failed (Result: exit-code)
# - Main PID: [crashed]
# - Last error message

# This tells us IMMEDIATELY what's wrong!
```

### STEP 3: Read Actual Logs

```bash
# System logs (most recent 200 lines)
sudo journalctl -u central-mcp -n 200

# Application logs (if they exist)
tail -100 /opt/central-mcp/logs/*.log

# Auto-sync log
tail -50 /home/lech/auto-sync.log

# These logs will show THE EXACT ERROR!
```

### STEP 4: Check Environment

```bash
# Check Node.js version
node --version

# Check if service directory exists
ls -la /opt/central-mcp/

# Check if dependencies installed
ls /opt/central-mcp/node_modules/ | wc -l

# Check current git commit
cd /opt/central-mcp && git rev-parse HEAD

# Check disk space
df -h

# Check memory
free -h

# Check processes
ps aux | grep node
```

### STEP 5: Try Manual Start

```bash
# Try to start manually (see error in real-time)
cd /opt/central-mcp
npm start

# Or if it uses a different command:
node dist/index.js

# This will show the EXACT startup error!
```

---

## 🎯 DIAGNOSTIC DECISION TREE

```
Can you SSH to VM?
├─ YES → Follow STEP 2-5 above
│         90% chance we find and fix the issue
│
└─ NO → Need to:
         1. Share gcloud credentials OR
         2. Give me temporary SSH access OR
         3. You SSH and paste logs to me
```

---

## 💡 WHAT I CAN DO RIGHT NOW (Without VM Access)

### Option A: Analyze Code Changes

```bash
# Compare the two commits
cd /Users/lech/PROJECTS_all/PROJECT_central-mcp
git diff a38e8ca 35aa5e37

# This shows WHAT CHANGED
# Can identify likely breaking changes
```

**Confidence:** 30% - Might spot obvious issues

### Option B: Review Service Configuration

```bash
# Check if systemd service file exists locally
find /Users/lech/PROJECTS_all/PROJECT_central-mcp -name "*.service"

# Check deployment scripts
cat /Users/lech/PROJECTS_all/PROJECT_central-mcp/scripts/deploy-to-vm.sh

# Review what the deploy does
```

**Confidence:** 20% - Can see what SHOULD be configured

### Option C: Prepare Fix Script

```bash
# Create a comprehensive VM fix script
# That you can run on the VM
# Based on common Node.js service issues
```

**Confidence:** 40% - Can prepare likely fixes

## 🔥 MY HONEST ASSESSMENT

**Current Understanding: 15%**
- I know service is crashed
- I know it's on the VM
- I don't know WHY it crashed
- I don't know the actual error

**Ability to Fix Without Logs: 5%**
- Too many possible causes
- Can't diagnose blindly
- Would be guessing

**Ability to Fix With Investigation: 70-85%**
- Most Node.js crashes have standard fixes
- With logs, can identify root cause
- With SSH, can test solutions
- High success rate once we see actual error

---

## 💎 THE TRUTH

**I NEED LOGS TO FIX THIS!**

Without seeing the actual error, I'm shooting in the dark.

**BEST PATH FORWARD:**
1. SSH to VM: `gcloud compute ssh lech@central-mcp-server --zone=us-central1-a`
2. Get logs: `sudo journalctl -u central-mcp -n 200`
3. Paste here
4. I diagnose with 85% confidence
5. We fix it together
