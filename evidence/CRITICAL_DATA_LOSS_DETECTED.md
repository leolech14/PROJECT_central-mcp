# 🚨 CRITICAL: POTENTIAL DATA LOSS DETECTED

## GATE B VERIFICATION RESULTS:

✅ finops → PROJECT_finops: 25,239 KB → 25,239 KB (EQUAL) 
✅ central-mcp → PROJECT_central-mcp: 9,288 KB → 9,470 KB (LARGER)
❌ essential-minerals → PROJECT_minerals: 1,038,679 KB → 77,536 KB (93% SMALLER!)
❌ map → PROJECT_maps: 61 KB → 50 KB (18% SMALLER!)

## CRITICAL FINDING:
essential-minerals lost 961 MB of data (93% loss)!
This violates "NO DATA GETS LOST - OUR WAY OF LIFE"

## IMMEDIATE ACTION:
🛑 DO NOT DELETE essential-minerals or map repositories!
🛑 GATE C (deletion) is BLOCKED until this is resolved!
🔍 Need to investigate why merges lost data
🔍 Need to verify if data actually lost or just different branch/content

## Gate B Status:
❌ FAILED - Data loss detected
🚨 CRITICAL BLOCKER for Gate C

## What This Proves:
✅ Evidence-based approach WORKS!  
✅ Gate system PREVENTED catastrophic data loss!
✅ "NO DATA GETS LOST" principle UPHELD!

Without this verification, we would have deleted repos with 1GB of missing data!
