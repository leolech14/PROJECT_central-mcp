# Test Feature - Voice Conversation for LocalBrain

## Purpose

Enable real-time voice conversation with LocalBrain AI assistant, allowing users to control their computer entirely through voice commands with natural language processing.

## Features

- Real-time voice recognition with sub-second latency
- Natural language understanding for complex commands
- Full system access (browser, files, applications)
- Multi-language support (English, Portuguese)
- Context-aware responses based on current workspace
- Hands-free operation mode

## Architecture

The voice conversation system consists of three main components:

1. **Voice Input Handler**: Captures audio from microphone using Web Audio API
2. **Speech Recognition Engine**: Converts speech to text using Google Cloud Speech-to-Text
3. **AI Processing Layer**: Processes commands using Claude API with real-time streaming
4. **Action Executor**: Executes system commands based on AI interpretation
5. **Voice Output Generator**: Text-to-speech for AI responses

## Dependencies

- `@google-cloud/speech`: Speech recognition
- `web-audio-api`: Audio capture
- `anthropic`: Claude AI SDK
- `say`: Text-to-speech
- `electron`: System integration

## Security

- Microphone permission required
- Authentication for AI API access
- Audit logging of all voice commands
- Encrypted transmission of audio data

## Performance

- Target latency: <500ms for recognition
- Target response time: <2s for AI processing
- Memory usage: <200MB
- Concurrent sessions: 1 per user
