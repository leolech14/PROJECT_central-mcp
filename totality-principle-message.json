  "content": "CENTRAL-MCP WAY OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT: TOTALITY PRINCIPLE. We have full-lists of stuff, we consolidate all units of specific concern together. This gives us property called TOTALITY - we know the list is complete, complete by its own definition, complete because we say it is. But we must always make sure we truly have ALL items for any specific list. Agent must keep own current tasks list to avoid getting carried by context flow and not building what is specified. Must operate FROM INSIDE Central-MCP, not outside. Leverage all systems it already has and fix systems that need tweaks to operate properly.",
